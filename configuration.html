	<h1>How programs should be configured</h1>
	<p>
		People tend to assume that GUI applications should be configured through a GUI and console applications should be configured through text files.  This seems strange.
	</p>
	<p>
		Is it actually true that a program should be configured the same way it's used?
	</p>
	<p>
		This is problematic, because different interfaces lead to different limitations.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, programs seem to stick to only 1 type of interface (console/text, GUI, speech, etc.).  This is limiting because different parts of the program might become more user-friendly if they had a different type of interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		Configuration can be thought of as changing a program slightly to turn it into the program you want.  In other words, before the program exists, we have a general-purpose programming language (e.g. C++) to tell computers what to do.  By writing a program, someone has made a more specific way to tell the computer what to do, which is easier for certain tasks than everyone writing their own program but still too general to be ideal for a given person's use of the program.
	</p>
	<p>
		The way I'd say it should often or always work, then, is to write a program which has a configuration language which is simpler to use than (perhaps is a subset of) the programming language used to write the program.  This configuration could take the form of a script, or could have a simpler syntax still, only allowing KEY=VALUE types of configurable variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider e-mail clients.  They generally fall into 2 groups: command-line based and GUI-based.  The command-line based clients suffer from being hard to use on a daily basis, because it's easier if you can point, click, drag, etc. your e-mail messages and if you can see HTML content as it was meant to be seen, click on hyperlinks, etc.  However, the graphical e-mail clients suffer from it being difficult to specify (not to mention program) filtering functionality - you've got to type filtering rules in individually, which means how do you move them around between computers, etc.  It would be much simpler if you could write a "program" to filter your e-mail, using an extremely simple language, perhaps a subset of BASIC.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise for Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).  A graphical IDE (theoretically) makes it easier to write programs.  But they all get the idea that people should do everything in a GUI.  That means you have to specify how to build your program by clicking checkboxes.  But it's easier to do so using a <b>language</b> such as the syntax in a Makefile.  If IDEs would realize this, they could greatly simplify their GUI and we just might be left with a user-friendly IDE.  But as it is, people have to choose between a difficult to use IDE or a difficult-to-use-together set of individual programming tools (gcc, make, gdb, etc.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Text-based functionality does not need to be cryptic, nor does creating a GUI mean you automatically have a user-friendly program.
	</p>
	<p>
		If people would just choose the most user-friendly combination of interfaces (and power should be taken into consideration in determining user-friendliness) for the application they're writing, whether that's text, GUI, speech, mouse gestures, moving around in a virutal 3-D environment, or whatever, we would be left with simpler, easier to use, and less buggy computer software.
