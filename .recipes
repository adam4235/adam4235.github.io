#Technically optional; if omitted, grocery list isn't written,
#but since this is such an important feature I don't see why you would
#omit it

#Where to write the resulting meal schedule.  Technically optional,

#An optional file of ingredients to add to the grocery list

#Optional.  If present, an output file which will contain a list
#of the recipes chosen by the program, in the form of a script.
#This is useful just to see the recipes that were chosen if you don't
#want a meal schedule, but is also a script to install these recipes
#as well as the grocery list on a Palm, if you have pilot-link and use
#Linux.  This is extremely useful to me so I can bring the grocery list
#to the grocery store and read the recipes as I'm cooking (since my
#computer isn't visible from my kitchen).
RECIPE_LIST=$HOME/Desktop/install_recipes

#Optional.  If present, the program will assume it contains a list
#of all ingredients you own.  If you then run "meals onhand", it will
#suggest recipes to you that you have most or all of the necessary 
#ingredients for already.  Also, when generating the grocery list,
#it will mark ingredients you already own so you can quickly delete 
#them from the list.
