	<h1>Meals program download - Adam Richard's web page</h1>

<p>Linux executable: <a href="meals-0.12.1-beta-x86">32-bit</a> or <a href="meals-0.12.6-beta-x64">64-bit</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in this program and use something other than Linux, <a href="email.html">E-mail me</a> and I might put Windows or Mac executables here for download.</p>

<p>The source code can be downloaded <a href="meals-0.12.6-beta.zip">here</a>, in ZIP format.  You don't need it to run the executables above.  Since this program is something of a quick-and-dirty solution to save me some time, the quality of the code is not necessarily up to my usual standard.  I don't think it's horrible, but I could certainly do better; I just don't think it's worthwhile to improve unless a bunch of people express interest in it.</p>

<p>You may use the code however you want, but you may not call it your own.</p>
