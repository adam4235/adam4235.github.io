<h1>Algebrain</h1>

<p class="tcenter">Algebrain is a game you can play for free.  Click <a href="https://algebrain.duckdns.org/">here</a> to try it.  It's in the Beta stage, so please give me <a href="../email.html">feedback</a>.</p>

<p><img src="screenshot.png" alt="Algebrain Screenshot" class="center" /></p>

<p class="tcenter">It's a video game about algebra, inspired by puzzle games such as
Tetris / Tetris Attack / Dr. Mario / Puyo Puyo.  However, when played 2
player, it's a cooperative game.</p>

<p class="tcenter">It's not intended to teach you algebra, but to train the brain
pathways that solve algebra equations, while (most importantly) being
fun.  I got the idea after noticing similarities between puzzle games
and algebra equations.</p>

<p class="tcenter">You can try the tutorial to learn how to play - if the tutorial didn't teach you, that <a href="../email.html">feedback</a> would help too.</p>

<h2>Controls:</h2>

<p>Algebrain can be played using a mouse or touch screen.  The tutorial teaches you how to play using a mouse or touch screen.</p>

<p>You could instead use a game controller (e.g. XBox or PS3/4/5 controller, or other controllers for PC gaming).  Here are the controls for a game controller:</p>

<p>
<b>Directional pad</b>: move the cursor<br />
<b>B button</b>: switch the orientation of the cursor (vertical / horizontal)<br />
<b>A button</b>: evaluate the tiles under the cursor (add / multiply them together if they're numbers, or collect like terms / expand / factor as appropriate)<br />
<b>X button</b>: switch the order of the expressions under the cursor (commutativity).<br />
<b>L1 Button / R1 Button</b>: Move an expression to the other side of the equation (if there's an arrow showing in the middle of the screen).<br />
<b>Y button</b>: immediately cause the next new group of tiles to appear, or the moving tiles to slide into place.<br />
<b>Start</b>: pause menu, with option to quit the game<br />
</p>

<p>It's also possible to play with a keyboard, though this isn't recommended.  Here are the keyboard controls:</p>

<p>
<b>Arrow keys</b>: move the cursor<br>
<b>Spacebar</b>: switch the orientation of the cursor (vertical / horizontal)<br>
<b>Enter</b>: evaluate the tiles under the cursor (add / multiply them together
 if they're numbers, or collect like terms / expand / factor as 
appropriate)<br>
<b>Tab</b>: switch the order of the expressions under the cursor (commutativity).<br>
<b>Shift</b>: Move an expression to the other side of the equation (if there's an arrow showing in the middle of the screen).<br>
<b>Page Down</b>: immediately cause the next new group of tiles to appear, or the moving tiles to slide into place.<br>
<b>Esc</b>: pause menu, with option to quit the game<br>
