<p>Algebrain is a game you can play for free.  Click <a href="https://algebrain.duckdns.org/">here</a> to try it.  It's in the Beta stage, so please give me <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a>.</p>

<p>It's a video game about algebra, inspired by puzzle games such as 
Tetris / Tetris Attack / Dr. Mario / Puyo Puyo.  However, when played 2 
player, it's a cooperative game.</p>

<p>It's not intended to teach you algebra, but to train the brain 
pathways that solve algebra equations, while (most importantly) being 
fun.  I got the idea after noticing similarities between puzzle games 
and algebra equations.</p>

<p>You can try the tutorial to learn how to play - if the tutorial didn't teach you, that <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a> would help too.</p>

<p>It can be played using a mouse or touch screen, or a game controller (e.g. XBox or PS3/4/5 controller, or other controllers for PC gaming).  Here are the controls for a game controller:</p>

<p>
Directional pad: move the cursor<br />
B button: switch the orientation of the cursor (vertical / horizontal)<br />
A button: evaluate the tiles under the cursor (add / multiply them together if they're numbers, or collect like terms / expand / factor as appropriate)<br />
X button: switch the order of the expressions under the cursor (commutativity).<br />
L1 Button / R1 Button: Move an expression to the other side of the equation (if there's an arrow showing in the middle of the screen).<br />
Y button: immediately cause the next new group of tiles to appear, or the moving tiles to slide into place.<br />
Start: pause menu, with option to quit the game<br />
</p>

<p>It's also possible to play with a keyboard, though this isn't recommended because it's probably the most difficult control method.  Here are the keyboard controls:</p>

<p>
Arrow keys: move the cursor<br>
Spacebar: switch the orientation of the cursor (vertical / horizontal)<br>
Enter: evaluate the tiles under the cursor (add / multiply them together
 if they're numbers, or collect like terms / expand / factor as 
appropriate)<br>
Tab: switch the order of the expressions under the cursor (commutativity).<br>
Shift: Move an expression to the other side of the equation (if there's an arrow showing in the middle of the screen).<br>
Page Down: immediately cause the next new group of tiles to appear, or the moving tiles to slide into place.<br>
Esc: pause menu, with option to quit the game<br>
