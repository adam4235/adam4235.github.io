<p>Algebrain is a game you can play for free.  Click <a href="http://adamr.dreamhosters.com/">here</a> to try it.  It's in the Beta stage, so please give me <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a>.</p>

<p>It's a video game about algebra, inspired by puzzle games such as Tetris / Tetris Attack / Dr. Mario / Puyo Puyo.  However, when played 2 player, it's a cooperative game.</p>

<p>It's not intended to teach you algebra, but to train the brain pathways that solve algebra equations, while (most importantly) being fun.  I got the idea after noticing similarities between puzzle games and algebra equations.</p>

<p>You can try the tutorial to learn how to play - if the tutorial didn't teach you, that <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a> would help too.</p>

<p>It's easiest to play using a mouse or touch screen, but in case you want to use a keyboard, here are the keyboard controls:</p>

<p>
Arrow keys: move the cursor<br />
Spacebar: switch the orientation of the cursor (vertical / horizontal)<br />
Enter: evaluate the tiles under the cursor (add / multiply them together if they're numbers, or collect like terms / expand / factor as appropriate)<br />
Tab: switch the order of the expressions under the cursor (commutativity).<br />
Shift: Move an expression to the other side of the equation (if there's an arrow showing in the middle of the screen).<br />
Page Down: immediately cause the next new group of tiles to appear, or the moving tiles to slide into place.<br />
Esc: pause menu, with option to quit the game<br />
