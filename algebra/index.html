<p>Algebrain is a game you can play for free.  Click <a href="http://104.225.142.74/">here</a> to try it.  It's in the Beta stage, so please give me <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a>.</p>

<p>It's a video game about algebra, inspired by puzzle games such as Tetris / Tetris Attack / Dr. Mario / Puyo Puyo.  However, when played 2 player, it's a cooperative game.</p>

<p>It's not intended to teach you algebra, but to train the brain pathways that solve algebra equations, while (most importantly) being fun.  I got the idea after noticing similarities between puzzle games and algebra equations.</p>

<p>You can try the tutorial to learn how to play - if the tutorial didn't teach you, that <a href="https://adam4235.github.io/email.html">feedback</a> would help too.</p>
