<body><h1>The C* Programming Language</h1>
<p>C* (pronounced C star), formerly CFlat, is a C++-based programming language.  It is not backwards compatible with C++, but is written in C++, translated to C++, and inspired by C++.  It is still under development and in alpha stage.  While the language itself is complete enough to write useful programs with, it has no IDE, debugger, or standard library, so is probably not useful at this time, except perhaps to write small script-like programs that are not business or safety critical.  I've tried to test all the features on a variety of small programs, but it hasn't been tested on large programs, nor does it have a formal semantics, so it probably contains errors.  It does, however, contain several language improvements over C/C++.

The following documentation describes the language informally, and especially how it differs from C++.  Some basic knowledge of C++ is required to understand it (advanced or technical details are reviewed in the documentation).
