<h1>Overview</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
Currently, the imperative and object-oriented portions of C* are mostly finished, which means it can do much of what C++ can do (plus several things better than C++).  Notable missing features are function pointers, which are missing because first-class functions are planned to eventually replace them, and generics (templates).  Notable differences from C++ are the addition of matrix operations to make numeric computations easier, and an improved object model (described <a href="polymorphism.html">later in the documentation</a>).
</p>
<p>
The eventual goal is a multi-paradigm language with a focus on combining functional and object-oriented styles of programming in interesting ways.  The major planned areas that still need to be implemented are the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Functional programming (first-class functions, etc.)</li>
	<li>Generics</li>
	<li>User-defined containers, which could be used with the same matrix features as the built-in arrays</li>
	<li><a href="/thesis.pdf">Pattern Matching as Dispatch</a></li>
	<li>Type Inference</li>
</ul>
<p>
The lack of a standard library and a debugger/IDE are also tradeoffs to consider before using the language in practice.
</p>
<p>
To read about ideas as they develop but which are not necessarily implemented, you can read the blog I use for the language, which is <a href="http://cstar-language.livejournal.com/">here</a>.

<b>Old Versions</b>
</p>
<p>
Version 0.2 was released in early 2008, and can be found by clicking <a href="/cstar-0.2-beta.zip">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The language began as my undergraduate honours thesis at the University of New Brunswick.  Version 0.1 is essentially my thesis.  You can get the thesis by clicking <a href="/cflat.pdf">here</a>.
