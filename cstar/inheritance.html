<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>Inheritance and subtyping</b>
</p>
<p>
C* makes a distinction between subtyping and inheritance.  It's possible to extend a class A with a class B, for ease of implementation, but to have no subtyping relation defined - so that the typechecker won't allow you to assign a B to a variable of type A.  This feature was introduced because of the fact that conceptually, not all derived classes introduce "is-a" relations, even if mechanically it looks like the derived class is an instance of the superclass.  So it's up to the programmer to specify whether an "is-a" relationship exists.
</p>
<p>
To inherit from a class without introducing a subtype, use the "extends" keyword:
</p>
<pre>
    class ColourPoint extends Point {
        ...
    };
</pre>
<p>
To specify that ColourPoint is both a subclass and a subtype, use the subtype operator:
</p>
<pre>
    class ColourPoint &lt;: Point {
        ...
    };
</pre>
<p>
Unlike C++, it is not necessary to write the "public" keyword to specify public inheritance; inheritance is public by default.
</p>
<p>
<b>Overriding</b>
</p>
<p>
To override a function in C*, you must declare it a function case:
</p>
<pre>
class Point {
    function draw();
};

class ColourPoint {
    function case draw();
};
</pre>
<p>
This restriction prevents accidental overriding, as well as misspelling the function name when overriding it and inadvertently introducing a new function.
</p>
<p>
Functions are "virtual" by default - that is, any plain member function can be overridden - whereas C++ required functions to be labelled "virtual"  to enable overriding.  To prevent a function from being overridden, label the function "final".  (C* has both final and const keywords.  The former means "can't be extended", while the latter means "can't be modified".)
</p>
<p>
The keyword "virtual" is now used for pure virtual functions (abstract classes) exclusively.  To declare an abstract class, label the functions that need to be implemented "virtual":
</p>
<pre>
class Shape {
    virtual function draw();  //the "= 0" syntax from C++ is no longer used
};
</pre>
<p>
It is an error to try to give an implementation to a function declared "virtual".
</p>
<p>
<b>Multiple inheritance</b>
</p>
<p>
Multiple inheritance is present in C*, but is slightly more restrictive than in C++, because it disallows ambiguities resulting from diamond inheritance.  That is, if a class inherits from multiple superclasses that each define a particular function, it's an error.  The error can be resolved by simply overriding the ambiguous member.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
class A {
    function f() =&gt; int { return 0; }
};
class B &lt;: A {
    function case f() =&gt; int { return 1; }
};
class C &lt;: A {
    function case f() =&gt; int { return 2; }
};
class D &lt;: B, C {};  //Error - which f does D inherit?
</pre>
<p>
If the programmer decides that D's f should behave like A's, they could resolve the ambiguity by overriding it to do so:
</p>
<pre>
class D &lt;: B, C {
    function case f() =&gt; int { return A.f(); }
};
</pre>
<p>
