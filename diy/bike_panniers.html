<h1>Making bike panniers out of buckets:</h1>
<p>These instructions are based on <a href="http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?doc_id=1841">this</a> website, but with some modifications.</p>
<ol>
<li>Need a large square bucket such as the one shown here from laundry detergent, and a ubolt, and I also used a bungee to make it more secure (bounce less.  This bucket is about 32cm tall x 30cm x 25cm.  2 ubolts might be better to make it more secure (bounce less).  I initially tried 2 hooks and a bungee like in the linked instructions, however, the hooks fell off when I went over a bump, and I couldn't find better hooks without that problem.<br>

<li>Drill 2 holes in the bucket matching the ubolt's screws.  Before drilling the holes, measure and poke 2 small holes with a pen or something and make sure the small holes / marks are in the right spot.  The holes can be slightly bigger than the screws because the screws have to be pushed into the holes.<br>

<li>Holding the bucket against the bike rack, screw the ubolt in so it attaches around the rack.<br>
