<h1>How To Fix A Leaky Faucet</h1>

<p>Mainly followed instructions <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fix-a-Leaky-Faucet">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some things to remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>Screw the large metal thing back on before turning the water back on - otherwise water spurts up the handle and knocks it off</li>
<li>Use a rag to absorb the water in the tap before trying to get the washer and spring out - that makes it easier.  Also don't push the washer and spring in further or they'll be quite hard to get out.</li>
</ol>
