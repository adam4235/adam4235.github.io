    <h3>Inbox Zero</h3>
    <p>Use your email inbox as a to-do list (this is called "Inbox 0"), where the goal is to keep your inbox at 0 messages.  First extract the useful information from the email (e.g. by adding it to your calendar or file system), if applicable, then either delete or archive the email.  You'll probably find that you almost never have to go back through your archives to see the email again, and it saves tons of time.</p>
