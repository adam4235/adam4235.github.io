    <h1>Wild Edible Plants in or Near Fredericton</h1>
    <p>These are some wild edible plants I've tried in Fredericton.</p>

    <h2>Wood Sorrel:</h2>
    <p>Looks like hearts and is found on lawns, and is lighter coloured than grass (the darker coloured hearts are usually clover).  Wood sorrel tastes like candy to me!</p>

    <h2>Pineapple Weed:</h2>
    <p>Tastes somewhat like pineapple, though I don't like this one that much.</p>

    <h2>Staghorn Suman:</h2>
    <p>These grow right on the walking trail in Fredericton!  You can soak one of the red fruit bunches in water to make a kind of lemonade.  I didn't like it that much but it wasn't terrible, kind of like tea.  I don't like tea but maybe someone who does like tea would like it?</p>
