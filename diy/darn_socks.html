<h1>How To Darn Socks</h1>

<ol>
<li>You need a darning needle and darning thread, not a regular needle and thread.</li>
<li>Put the yarn through the needle but no need to make a knot, it should stay if you just weave it.  Just pull the thread through the needle a bit, so there's one short end and one long end (no need to double it like when sewing on a button).</li>
<li>Put something in the sock around the hole like a tennis ball or a light bulb.  This is to cause the sock to maintain its shape - if it gets bunched up when you're darning, it will be uncomfortable to wear, like you have rocks in your shoes.</li>
<li>Thread in and out in a circle around the hole.</li>
<li>Thread a bunch of rows over the hole, then a bunch of columns, like a grid.</li>
<li>When you're doing the columns, go over and under each alternating row (weaving).</li>
<li>At the end, go in and out at a non-hole part of the sock to reinforce it.</li>
</ol>
