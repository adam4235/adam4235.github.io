    <h1>How To Configure Controllers For PC Gaming</h1>
    <h3>PS3 Controller:</h3>
    <p>To use a PS3 DualShock controller for PC games in Windows, I used the ScpToolkit driver, and followed <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ps3-controller-on-pc-guide/">this</a> guide.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Note: this driver is old and isn't maintained anymore, but it still worked for me.</li>
        <li>Note: this requires plugging in the controller via USB, rather than using Bluetooth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It tells you to install these prerequisities:
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5</li>
        <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package</li>
        <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 runtime</li>
        <li>Microsoft DirectX runtime</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Linux support for the PS3 controller seems to be good.  It worked for me right away on my laptop.</p>

    <h3>Steam Controller Layouts:</h3>
    <p>For some Steam games, it's necessary to change the controller layout.  To do this, right click the game in the Steam library -&gt; Manage -&gt; Controller Layout.  Then download one of the community layouts.  I had to do this for Final Fantasy VII, for which the default controller layout was very bad and the D-Pad didn't work at all.</p>
