Cleaner ingredients:

The book "Early Retirement Extreme" says that you can mix your own household cleaners from certain staple ingredients rather than the expensive proprietary formulas of store-bought cleaners.  The staple ingredients are ammonia, baking soda, borax, chlorine, soap, and clear vinegar.  But remember you should never combine chlorine and ammonia.
