Vinegar isn't a good cleaner after all (it's a good disinfecter), according to http://aciscience.org/docs/Alternative_Hard_Surface_Cleaners.pdf
What are soap granules?
	-Shavings of soap
What is liquid castile soap?
	-A traditional soap recipe now made with vegetable oils
	-Some brands are tested on animals
	-The bars of soap seem similar to liquid castile soap, except they're not open
What's the difference between soap and detergent?
	-Soap is made of natural ingredients (namely from living things), whereas detergent is synthetic (made of chemicals).
What should you use to clean your body?

Solution:
Body: bars of olive oil soap (pretty much the same as castile)
Hair: bar of soap
Deoderant: keep using baking soda despite the pH issue
Dishes: use dishsoap instead of dish detergent (liquid castile soap can apparently be used).
