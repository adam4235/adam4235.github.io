Germ cream (Glo Germ) and ultraviolet light - use it to find where germs are.  Unknowns:
-Air dry vs. towel dry?
http://www.webmd.com/news/20010817/air-dry-your-dishes suggests that air drying is better
-hot water or cold water to wash dishes?
	I kind of already know that it doesn't kill germs but makes it easier to clean dishes

But I don't know if it's worth buying, because the presence of germs doesn't necessarily mean it's dangerous or a problem, since many germs are good for you - so it still doesn't answer the question of what the best approaches to those types of cleaning are.
