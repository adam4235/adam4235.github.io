I found that these didn't work very well - there was a white film left on the dishes.  Might have been the dishwasher.

Saywardâ€™s Homemade Dishwasher Detergent

1 part borax (see description of borax here)

1 part washing soda (see description of washing soda here)

distilled white vinegar

(Other sites, like this:

http://frugalliving.about.com/od/cleaningtipsandrecipes/qt/Dish_Detergent.htm

 said to use baking soda instead of washing soda.  Washing soda seems to be the one to use, I guess.)

Note that, according to the site linked to from here:

http://www.welltellme.com/discuss/index.php?topic=20783.0

you can make washing soda from baking soda by baking it on a cookie sheet at 450F for 30 min.  Perhaps I could try baking it with my bread?

-There's also one at True Food Organics that says its ingredients:
Sodium citrate
polymer (organic)
But the polymer seems a bit fishy - that's a very general term.  It's also pretty expensive, and the container was only about 1/2-2/3 full.

There was one at Home Hardware that said the ingredients.
