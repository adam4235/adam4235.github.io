I tried this but it didn't work well - there was a white film left on the clothes.  

At least buying liquid soap instead of powder may be best, because it probably works better with cold water.

Homemade Laundry Soap

1/3 bar Fels Naptha (or some other laundry bar?)

1/2 cup Arm and Hammer washing soda (or some other washing soda?)

1/2 cup borax powder

~You will also need a small bucket, about 2 gallon size~



Grate the soap and put it in a sauce pan. Add 6 cups water and heat it until the soap melts. Add the washing soda and the borax and stir until it is dissolved. Remove from heat. Pour 4 cups hot water into the bucket. Now add your soap mixture and stir. Now add 1 gallon plus 6 cups of water and stir. Let the soap sit for about 24 hours and it will gel. You use 1/2 cup per load.


~The finished soap will not be a solid gel. It will be more of a watery gel.

You should be able to find all these ingredients in the laundry isle of your local super market.


Make sure you get WASHING soda, NOT BAKING soda.


What I did:
-Take 1/3 of a laundry bar from Bulk Barn
-Grate it into an electric frying pan
-Add 6c water
-Heat until the soap melts (about 5-10 minutes).  Boil 4c water at the same time
-Add 1/2 c borax (can buy at hardware store) and 1/2 c washing soda (found at Wal Mart) to the soap mixture.  Stir until they dissolve.
-Pour soap mixture and hot water into a 2 gallon bucket.
-Add 5L plus 2 c water (22 c water)
-Stir
-Leave for 24 hours
-Use 1/2 c per load
