    Baa Baa Black Sheep
    Baby Beluga
    Ants go Marching
    Do Your Ears Hang Low
    Farmer in the Dell
    Going on a Lion Hunt
    Grandfather's Clock
    Hole in the bottom of the sea
    If You're Happy and You Know It
    Itsy Bitsy Spider
    Jingle Bells
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt
Mary Had a Little Lamb
My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean
On Top of Spaghetti
Open Up Your Heart and Let the Sun Shine in
Puff the Magic Dragon
She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain
There's a Hole in the Bucket
You Are My Sunshine
