They say the "BRAT" diet (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast) is good when you have a flu and don't feel like eating much.  It's still probably good to avoid eating when you don't feel like eating, as well.

Honey seems like it might help too.  

They say apple cider vinegar, and gargling with it, can help with a bad taste in the mouth.  I tried it and it might have helped a bit but it was hard to say.

Avoid dairy.

Chicken noodle soup is supposed to help, but I got a lot of stomach gurgling and pain after taking it.  I also got that after eating other things though, so I'm not sure whether it was the soup.  The soup tasted good but I didn't notice it help much anyway.

Soda crackers are easy to eat when you don't feel like eating too.

Ginger tea helps reduce nausea.
