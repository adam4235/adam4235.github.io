How to tell when nuts are rancid
	(keep in freezer to avoid them going rancid)

   1.
      Taste one of the nuts. Ask if you can sample a nut if you're in a store and the nuts are sold loose in a bin. If the nut tastes sour or bitter, it has become rancid.

   2.
      Smell the nut to learn if it's still fresh. Rancid nuts have an unpleasant fishy odor.

   3.
      Visually inspect the nuts. Nuts that have darkened in color is a sure sign they've turned rancid. Check that the nuts haven't become shriveled, dry or moldy in appearance.
