Eating wild mushrooms:

There are many different varieties, and it's quite dangerous to try mushrooms without being sure.  Requires a lot of research, and checking different features (not just sight) - e.g. what it's growing on, what it smells like.

Some beginner types of mushrooms to try:
Chanterelle 
Shaggymane 
Helecium 
Oyster 
Boletus
