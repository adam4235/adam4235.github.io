How to darn socks
-You need a darning needle and darning thread, not a regular needle and thread
-Put the yarn through the needle but apparently there's no need to make a knot, it should stay if you just weave it.  Just pull the thread through the needle a bit, so there's one short end and one long end (no need to double it like when sewing on a button).
-Put something in the sock around the hole like a tennis ball or a light bulb.  This is to cause the sock to maintain its shape - if it gets bunched up when you're darning, it will be uncomfortable to wear, like you have rocks in your shoes.
-thread in and out in a circle around the hole
-thread a bunch of rows over the hole, then a bunch of columns, like a grid.
-When you're doing the columns, go over and under each alternating row (weaving).
-At the end, go in and out at a non-hole part of the sock to reinforce it.
