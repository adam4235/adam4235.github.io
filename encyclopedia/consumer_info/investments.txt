-To invest through a bank your options are pretty much only GICs, mutual funds (including bond funds), or Direct Investing, which is their trading platform for trading stocks.  Neither of them had ethical funds - that seems to require directly trading stocks.

-You can find mutual funds on the different bank websites.  Once you have an investment account set up, you can buy and sell them online, from the bank account you have linked to the investment account.

-When you set up an investment account with a bank in Canada, they're required by the government to ask you a bunch of questions relating to your investment preferences (e.g. how much risk you're willing to accept).  Depending on your answers they're only allowed to sell you certain mutual funds.  This is a requirement for getting a license to sell mutual funds in Canada, apparently.
