	-Salomon actually did better than New Balance in this report


Salomon - mentioned in a report with problems, but in another study did better than New Balance and it seemed they followed the labor laws
New Balance - not as bad (many shoes made in U.S.)
Merrell - worse than New Balance, according to a rating, but one person claimed they're pretty good (but their reference didn't say one way or another).
North Face - mentioned in a report with problems, but mentioned in another report for environmentally good practices
Oboz - according to themself, they seem to be an ethical company with good labour practices and they plant a tree for every shoe sold.  However, they don't have non-leather shoes.
