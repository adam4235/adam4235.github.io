Considered converting my bike to a single speed bike (not fixed gear bike) for winter, but the person at Radical Edge said the gear itself (not just the chain) would have to be replaced regularly as well.

Coaster brakes (back pedal brakes / foot brakes - not the fixed gear brakes which simply make the wheels turn the other way when you pedal backwards.) might be best.

Radical edge can convert my old bike for about $100 (so can Ski Wolf, but not until the spring).
