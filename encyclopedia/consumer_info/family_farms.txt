Went to check out their chickens (Aug 2017).  They were indeed free range - although there was a fence (probably to protect them from predators), the door was open and they were roaming around.  They could run away if they wanted to, but they don't.

Yerxa's - they don't actually have cows.  They're a meat packer, which means their beef comes from a variety of places.
