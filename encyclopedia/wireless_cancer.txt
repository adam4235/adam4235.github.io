Investigated whether wifi can cause cancer.
The National Cancer Institute says even cell phones haven't been proven to cause cancer, but only to heat up tissue:

Electromagnetic radio radiation, which comes from radios, cell phones, and wifi, are non-ionizing, which is only known to heat things up, unlike x-rays etc which are ionizing.

Wikipedia says that it's the power level of the wireless signal that determines how potentially harmful it is.  Wifi has a similar power level to cell phones, however a router isn't right next to your body, so it's much safer, because the power level decreases with an inverse square relationship to the distance.

But it's still possible that laptops and phones, which transmit wireless signals, are transmitting them at a significant power level and are next to your body.
