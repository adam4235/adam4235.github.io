Classic arcade games:
-Pong (has one free version at https://www.ponggame.org)
-Pac Man (I have Pac Man Vs., and it's included in Namco Museum)
-Space Invaders (open-invaders on Linux)
-Asteroids (I already downloaded a free javascript-based version from http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/)
-Donkey Kong (I already have Mario vs. Donkey Kong)
-Donkey Kong Jr.
-Donkey Kong 3
-Dig Dug (part of Namco Museum for Switch, or also available on Steam)
-Galaga (it's mostly a 2D space shooter though, and there are better ones) (part of Namco Museum for Switch, or also available on Steam)
-Centipede
-Millipede
-Missile Command
-Breakout
-Joust
-Mario Bros. (included in Mario Advance)

It seems like you can also play a lot of these classic arcade games at https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom.
It doesn't seem to work though - many games take forever to load and then pressing various buttons doesn't seem to do anything.

It looks like the Internet Archive can legally allow you to play old games in your browser if they aren't for sale anymore:

Atari Vault has 100 games (but not all the good ones). Â It's on Linux.  It lets you play online multiplayer.

There's also ARCADE GAME SERIES on Steam which contains 3 games, Ms. Pac Mac

There's also the Atari Flashback series of physical "mini" consoles that try to replicate the Atari 2600 but with games built-in.  But they still don't have all the good games: Pac-Man and Ms. Pac Man are missing, and the Donkey Kong games, and Dig Dug, Galaga, Joust, Mario Bros are all missing from it.

It does seem like a lot of these games are from the Atari 2600.
