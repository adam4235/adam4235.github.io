Some things to remember:
-Screw the large metal thing back on before turning the water back on - otherwise water spurts up the handle and knocks it off
-Use a rag to absorb the water in the tap before trying to get the washer and spring out - that makes it easier.  Also don't push the washer and spring in further or they'll be quite hard to get out.
