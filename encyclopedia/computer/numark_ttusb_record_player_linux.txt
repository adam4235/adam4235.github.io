To record a record with the Numark TTUSB record player in Linux:

Need the Audacity software.

Before starting Audacity, first plug it into USB and plug the record player into an outlet.

In the Sound Settings for the operating system (this was with Pop_OS!), select the Input Device as Analog Input - PCM2900 Audio Codec
Start Audacity.  In Audacity, leave the Input Device and Playback Device as Default.  I think this means it will take the Input Device / Output Device chosen in the operating system.
If you want the music to play as you're recording it, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Recording and check Software Playthrough of Input
Put the needle at the start of the record.
Press Record in Audacity.
Push play on the record player to start the turntable.
