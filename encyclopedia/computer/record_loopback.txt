How to record the audio coming from your speakers (also called recording "Stereo Mix" or loopback Output), and make a video of what's happening on your computer:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110696/arecord-to-record-what-is-playing-on-speakers

This worked:
arecord -D pulse_monitor test.wav

after setting up ~/.asoundrc as this:
pcm.pulse_monitor {
    type pulse
    device alsa_output.usb-0d8c_Generic_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo.monitor
}

ctl.pulse_monitor {
    type pulse
    device alsa_output.usb-0d8c_Generic_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo.monitor
}

To make a video of what's happening on your computer (you have to wait while it encodes the video afterwards, otherwise it can get cut off):
recordmydesktop --device=pulse_monitor
