If you install Syncthing Tray, it can be configured to start Syncthing in Windows so that there's no console output window in your way.

-Run Syncthing Tray
-Set it to start at startup
-Set it to start Syncthing at startup (you have to give it the path to the Syncthing executable, and it gets run with the --no-browser option by default)
-Don't set Syncthing to start at startup on its own
