By plugging a USB cord into your computer, you can use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to enter text on your computer and have it get typed into your phone.
You first have to enable Developer Options on the phone, then USB debugging in Developer options.

Then plug the phone into the computer and in a terminal on the computer enter:
adb shell
input keyboard text 'Hello World'

to, for example, type the text Hello World on the phone.  Note you have to press enter after "adb shell"; otherwise you'll have difficulty typing spaces.

If you just want to enter SMS text messages with your computer, then you can instead use KDE Connect, the SMS plugin.  That prevents you from needing to plug in the phone and may be more user friendly.
