Connecting my computers to a home network: SAMBA seems to work pretty well.  Windows has it built-in, Linux can use it (I configured Linux as the server - config is in sudo gvim /etc/samba/smb.conf), and my iPhone can use it with the FE File Explorer app.  You need to set the IP address of the server to be static / fixed (through the router configuration) so you can connect to that IP address.  Note that giving a fixed IP address to a device is only a fixed address for use on the home network - it doesn't mean anyone on the internet can connect to it.  192.168.2.1 is the router.  Addresses that start with 192.168 mean "computers on this network".
