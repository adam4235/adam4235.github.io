To make a recording of your desktop, Kazam works.  You have to select the correct audio device in Preferences, though, and it's difficult to figure out which one to select.
sudo apt install kazam

Then to convert to ogv:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libtheora -q:v 7 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 output.ogv

Older methods that used to work, but didn't last time I tried them:

How to record the audio coming from your speakers (also called recording "Stereo Mix" or loopback Output), and make a video of what's happening on your computer:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/110696/arecord-to-record-what-is-playing-on-speakers

arecord -D pulse_monitor test.wav

after setting up ~/.asoundrc as this:
pcm.pulse_monitor {
    type pulse
    device alsa_output.usb-0d8c_Generic_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo.monitor
}

ctl.pulse_monitor {
    type pulse
    device alsa_output.usb-0d8c_Generic_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo.monitor
}

To make a video of what's happening on your computer (you have to wait while it encodes the video afterwards, otherwise it can get cut off):
recordmydesktop --device=pulse_monitor
