How to write udev rules (overview of http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html):

1. Find out what name the kernel is currently giving your device

2. With the device plugged in with that name, go to the /sys directory

3. Use the command "find /sys -name dev", where dev is the name of the device, to get a path the the sysfs info for the device.

4. With that path, run"
udevadm --info --query=all --path=<path>
where "path" is the path determined in step 3
(On Gentoo, they seem to have replaced this command with udevadm info)

You should get a bunch of potential rules like this:

    SUBSYSTEM=="block"
    ATTR{stat}=="  128535     2246  2788977   766188    73998   317300  3132216 5735004        0   516516  6503316"
    ATTR{size}=="234441648"
    ATTR{removable}=="0"
    ATTR{range}=="16"

Any of those rules can be copied and pasted into the udev rules file (/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules) to be used as a rule to match that device.
