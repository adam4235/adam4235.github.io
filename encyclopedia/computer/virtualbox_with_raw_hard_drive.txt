If you use VirtualBox and make the hard drive map to a separate real hard drive with a different operating system, you can put Linux and Windows each on their own hard drive, and use VirtualBox to run either one from within the other, while still being able to boot either one when you start your computer.

Here are the instructions:

When following those instructions, one thing they omit is that you have to run the setup commands and VirtualBox as root / Administrator.  At least I couldn't find an alternative that worked.

Another problem I ran into is that with a Windows host, the physical hard drive kept changing, probably when I switched the drives around or did something in the BIOS.  This is because Windows references the hard drive by a number (0 or 1 if there are 2 hard drives), rather than by something like a UUID.  So you have to be careful not to boot it if the hard drive has changed.
