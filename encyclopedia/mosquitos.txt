Strategies to avoid mosquitos:

-bug jacket
-put geranium plants, citronella candles or fresh onion slices on windowsills to ward them off
-natural repellants for the skin: mix almond or soya-based oils with 2-3 drops of eucalyptus, peppermint, or citronella oils (put it on your skin)
-use sprays & lotions containing DEET (maybe don't use it on children)
-remove water/wet areas
-they're out more often during dusk & dawn
-light colored clothing
-attract birds that eat mosquitos (like Purple Martins)
-If you get a bite, then within 2 hours run hot water over a spoon (or otherwise heat up a spoon, but not too hot) then hold the spoon on the bite for 30 seconds.  It makes it go away supposedly.
