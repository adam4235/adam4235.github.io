How to turn your lawn into a garden:

1. Cut away the grass with a sod cutter (or perhaps a shovel - that's what I did the first time, for a small area).
2. Replace the removed soil with topsoil and then compost on top (or perhaps just compost would work?)  (In Knowlesville, they made soil out of swales - manure, straw, and sticks)
3. Till it to mix everything together (or perhaps just mixing it with a simple tool would work?)
