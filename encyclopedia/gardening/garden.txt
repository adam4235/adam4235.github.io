How to garden:

-Gardening starts in the spring - as early as March for some things.
-Have to get good soil.  It consisted of partly normal soil, plus composted matter and peat moss.
-Add lots of water to the soil.  It's dry initially.
-Plant seeds in it (buy at the store or use seeds from last year's plants).  Follow the instructions for each plant - they have to be planted a certain distance apart and you have to add soil on top of them.
