-To get the seeds from a plant, let the plant grow a while past when you would normally harvest it, so it's rotting / wilting.  Then pick it.
-Get the seeds out, put them in a cool dry place (fridge / freezer will make them last for years, but probably not necessary if using them in a year or two).
"Seeds of Diversity" and "Seeds of Exchange" are organizations where you can get seeds from lots of varieties of plants.  Seeds can cross the border, even though plants can't always.
-Jerusalem artichokes are like potatoes, and are good for diabetics (regulate blood sugar)
