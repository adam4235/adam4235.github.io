At least with my Norco Pinnacle:
-Stand in front of the bike and look at the headlight.  To the right of it and up, there's an allen wrench nut with a cable coming out of it.  Loosen the nut, pull the cable tighter, and tighten it again.
-Also loosen or tighten the knobs on the handlebars - though the guy at Capital City Cycles said this is less important, more for emergency when you're out.
-The brake pads should be close to the wheel for the brakes to work well.
-As long as you can still see the treads in the brake pads, they're still good.

On bike with disc brakes:
-Also have to adjust the thing on the wheel at the same time as adjusting the thing on the handlebar, so the brake pads will be balanced.  The guy at Ski Wolf tried to show me how to do this, and it seemed very difficult.  You have to use an allen wrench (the L shaped wrench) and adjust it just the right amount so that the brake pads are evenly spaced.  Can use a credit card and slide it between the disc and brake pad to check the spacing.  Should probably look it up online to get a better idea of how to do it.
