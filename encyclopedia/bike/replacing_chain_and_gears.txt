You can get tools for replacing bike cassette and chain.  For example:

https://www.amazon.ca/Bicycle-Removal-Extractor-Bracket-Remover/dp/B077MZGRFK/

is the link Chris sent me.  It contains:

1 x Flywheel wrench, 1 x Chain breaker, 1 x Crank puller, 1 x Sprocket remover, 1 x Bottom bracket crank puller.  Together they form a "Bike Cassette Removal Tool".

I did try to remove the chain but failed.

Could also just try using a single speed bike instead - it might not be as good but might be worth a try for reduced maintenance.
