Repairing a bike's flat tire or a hole in the tire:
--------------------------------------------------
1.Put the bike upside down
2.Take the wheel off (the flat one) along with any parts that must come off.
Remember how to put it back together.
3.Take out the inner tube by prying the outer tube off with a prying tool.
4.If you don't know where the hole is, put the inner tube in water & watch for
bubbles.
5.Sand the area around the hole.
6.Put rubber cement on it.  Wait 10 minutes.
  (or, instead of steps 6 & 7, use a patch like the one that came with my bike kit)
7.Put a patch over the area.
8.Put everything back.
