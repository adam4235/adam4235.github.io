-Toilet leaks cost money. Would you know if your toilet was leaking? Toilets use about 27% of household water. However, toilet leaks are invisible, waste water, and cost you money.

Take the toilet leak test:
• Put a drop of food colouring in the toilet tank.
• After 10 min, your toilet bowl water should still be clear.
• If the water is not clear, then you have a leak.
• If you have a leak, repair it.
