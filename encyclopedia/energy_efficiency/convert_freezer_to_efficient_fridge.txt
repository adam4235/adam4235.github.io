    I've mentioned in a couple of threads on this forum about a great conversion project for a fridge in the garage. I converted an old chest freezer that I purchased for $40 used and a digital thermostat I got off of ebay for less than $20. It uses on average a little less than 190 wh per day. Very easy to run on solar, of which I do.

    These are a couple of links to the references I used to blueprint my DIY project off of. They are not advertisements, so I hope they don't get deleted by the mods, as I think that they offer good information for people interested in doing the same.

    After looking at a couple of the articles, it gets kind of redundant. The premise is the same, and the controller is a variant of the same thing as well.

    Here is a YouTube video of the same idea.

    Again, this is one of the best projects I have done with my DIY solar panels. My converted freezer to fridge uses on average less than190 watt hours a day, and I have over 15 cu ft of fridge in my garage!

    Good luck in your endeavours.
