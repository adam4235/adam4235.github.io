The slides came from a workshop I did at Free School.  Some references from the numbers in the slides:

Hot water: 5 gallons = 1kWh, according to this:
    http://energy.gov/eere/femp/energy-cost-calculator-electric-and-gas-water-heaters-0
And an 8 min shower takes about 10 gallons

Lawnmower seems to use about 0.59 gallons per hour http://www.ehow.com/info_12217386_far-can-lawn-mower-ride-one-tank.html

-carbon footprint of burning gas
    1 gallon = 0.00889 metric tons  (from http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html)
-mileage of car: about 48 kilometers per gallon
    1 gallon = 0.00889 metric tons  (from http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html)
    So going 1000 km is about 0.185 metric tons for Joseph
  = 181.899277752 g/km CO2 
  = 0.000182 metric tons
  So I use 0.182 metric tons from driving Joseph
-carbon footprint of a kilowatt hour: 0.00069 metric tons (from http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html) 
-carbon footprint of a plane / train / bus
    0.22 metric tons to go from Fredericton to Toronto and back.  0.02 to go about the same distance (2000km) by train.  0.34 by car.
