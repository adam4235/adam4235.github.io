Fridge used 1.2kWh in about 24 hours (on a day that I opened it a bit more than usual)
But over a week (including that day) it used only 5.41kWh and was on for 44h51min (the first day it was on for 9h and something).
So opening it does seem to waste quite a bit of energy, but it doesn't seem to use that much.

To measure the electricity use of specific devices, you can borrow an energy meter from the library.

To see my calculations of electricity usage for specific things, see my slides on carbon footprint:
