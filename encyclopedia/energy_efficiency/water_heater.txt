approx energy used to heat up my hot water tank from room temperature
175L of water being heated 40 degrees
= 175kg of water being heated 40 degrees
= 175 * 1000 * 40 grams being heated 1 degree
= 175 * 1000 * 40 calories
= 175 * 1000 * 40 * 4.186 joules
= 175 * 1000 * 40 * 4.186 * 2.778x10-7 kWh
= 8.14 kWh
which costs $1
So it costs an extra $4 per month to have a hot water heater that's too big, since the water maintains its temperature for about a week if turned off.
Or an extra $40 per year
So it would take 100 years before a new water heater paid for itself.  But it seems like tankless water heaters can be pretty cheap, and would avoid this cost.

You can add an insulation blanket to a water heater to save energy.  It makes a significant difference mainly if you have a water heater that is warm to the touch (which means it's old and inefficient).

You can add a water heater timer to a water heater to make it turn off during peak hours, which reduces carbon emissions (and in some places, saves money).  However, NB Power says not to do this, because if the water gets too cold, bacteria can grow in it (that's why they factory set the temperature to 60C by default).
