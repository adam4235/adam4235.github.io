But the value I used was 48 lbs per year of CO2 for a fully grown tree
48lbs = 21.8kg
15 trees planted = 15 * 21.8kg = 327kg = 0.327 metric tons

When I looked it up again I found that 48 isn't that great of a number to use.  This calcuation is better:
One tree absorbs 22 lbs per year of CO2 in its first 20 years of life
22lbs = 10kg
15 trees planted = 150kg = 0.15 metric tons

However, Silver Maple trees get huge and absorb a lot more CO2 than the average tree, so these are probably underestimates for silver maples.
