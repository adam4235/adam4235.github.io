Research on solar panels Jul 2014:
-Started thinking about it because I noticed that if I could cover my heat via a method besides electricity, and get solar panels to cover the rest, then I could go off-grid and avoid the $20 + HST monthly fee, which is significant over a lifetime.
-Wind energy seems even less useful than solar in this part of the world.  With wind turbines you need to have them up really high.
-Debbie from True Food Organics says she has a root cellar to store cold food and said something about fridges not working on solar panels.  However I think they would work, they just use a lot of energy normally - but you can get or make efficient ones that open from the top.
    -She said she has 12 panels and 12 batteries that she got used for about $3000 20 years ago that provide all her electricity
    -But she can't use an electric stove
    -She also said don't put them on the roof, because you have to clean snow off them.  But lots of people seem to do that - maybe look into whether there's a way to avoid having to clean the snow off them (can they heat up to melt the snow?).
-This says if you connect to the grid, then any time you generate more electricity than you use, you'd get back the same amount later:

    -but you'd probably still have to pay the monthly fee
http://www.fundysolar.com/ - looks like they sell and install systems
    -They also claim to have a much more efficient fridge, which might be interesting
-Solar panels seem a lot cheaper now than they were back when I wrote this:
http://humansarentrational.blogspot.ca/2010/09/solar-energy-heat-pumps-and-other.html
However, they still seem too expensive - about $6000 for a system that provides my summer electricity usage (about 200-300kWh).  That would take about 20-30 years to pay for itself, if I remain on-grid.
-Whether you're on-grid or off-grid, you need an inverter, and in both cases it's expensive.  The inverter converts DC to AC which devices need.
-With off-grid you need batteries, with on-grid you don't need batteries.
-This looks neat, but isn't available to buy yet:

-Stove tops typically use over 1000 watts
-Induction stove tops seem about the same
-A hybrid inverter seems capable of being used in on-grid or off-grid mode
Here's one for sale that's rated up to 18kW, which would surely be enough to run a stove etc. (if you had enough panels).  However I wouldn't need one with such a high rating, so I could probably find a cheaper one:
http://www.wholesalesolar.com/products.folder/inverter-folder/xantrexxw4548.html
-The issue with being unable to use high-energy things is that they have a startup wattage rating that's higher than their regular rating, so you need an inverter rated at least that high to be able to handle that much current

Other ideas to reduce electricity usage prior to switching to solar panels, or just for the sake of reducing electricity usage:
-heat pump (whether air-source or geothermal): but that would basically lock me into using electricity for heat.  There might be better ways to get heat, particularly a passive house or a wood stove, or things that are invented in the future.
-stove: if I had a wood stove I could cook with that instead, and also use it for heat.
-heat: a passive house, a wood stove, or move to a warm climate
-fridge: get a fridge that's loaded from the top, or make one out of a freezer.  There are lots of links on the internet about this, e.g.:
http://www.ehow.com/how_5684552_convert-chest-freezer-refrigerator.html
http://lifehacker.com/5334245/convert-a-chest-freezer-into-a-super-efficient-refrigerator
-computer / TV: switch to a laptop
-lights: switch to LED lights, which are only about 8W per light bulb
-Water heating: solar water heater, which is much more efficient than heating your water with electricity via solar panels.  A solar water heater just has pipes on the outside of your house that the water goes through to be heated by the sun (still need a tank of water inside).
    -Solar water heaters still seem to be a bit expensive, however they're about the same price as a regular water heater.  So if I replace a regular water heater with a solar one, it should save money overall.
    -It seems like regular water heaters need replacement every 20 years or so anyway.
    -Perhaps another idea is to just get the collector part (the one that's meant to pre-heat the water) to attach to my existing water tank, but turn off my normal hot water heater.  However would leaving it turned off too long wear it out?  Also my tank is much bigger than I need - a smaller tank would take less energy to keep the water hot, and solar might not be enough for my big tank.

Looked into solar water heating from one company, www.nlsolarheating.com.  They're in Winnipeg and make ones that work in cold climates.  They had a complete system for ~$3500 Canadian that you can attach to an existing tank, plus they sell tanks to attach to them.  So one idea would be to get one and attach it to my existing tank, then replace the tank when it needs replacing.

Hi,
I live in Fredericton, NB.  I'm considering a solar water heater.  I have an existing hot water tank.  I'm wondering whether it's possible to do the following:

1. Buy just the solar collector, and anything necessary to hook it up to my existing tank, and connect it to my existing tank, to get some water heating from the sun.

2. Then, when my existing tank wears out in a few years, replace it with one of your tanks, of an appropriate size to get all my water heating from the sun (probably a smaller tank than I have now).

Is this possible, and if so, is there any extra infrastructure I'd have to buy now that I wouldn't need later?

Reply:
Hi Adam, Yes it is possible to use your existing tank I would suggest you go this website www.nlsolarheating.com  click on solar heating packages go to SWHR-1 complete pre- engineered solar domestic hot water kit website price is $3500.00 Canadian Funds taxes are extra. We will prepay your shipping costs to one of the five  major DAY& Ross freight depot in New Brunswick.  In a few years if your domestic hot water tank fails you could purchase a  standard tank or add a  solar storage tank with internal heat exchangers. 

Please let us know if you would like to process the order.

Thank-you Alan

The things that are included in the solar water heating kit are:
-collector
-pump to pump the hot water
-piping
-solar heating fluid (I guess only needed in cold climates?)
-solar air vent and heat exchanger - ?

It seems like that one might be more advanced than is necessary.  Of course it's not very cost-effective for me as just one person either.
You can also build solar water heaters though - but maybe only for warmer climates, I'm not sure.  You can even use your old hot water tank to build a solar one.  Some examples of ones to build:

-Another problem with off-grid solar panels is that in the winter you get less energy, so if you needed enough panels to cover your winter electricity usage, you'd be wasting some energy in the summer.
-One way around this is to use an electric stove in the summer, and a wood stove in the winter, to help balance it out
-Perhaps if I get a passive tiny home, I could have a separate unheated lodge-like building with a fireplace.  It could be for company, for heat if the passive house doesn't work well enough on some days, and for cooking if I'm out of solar power.
    -Or maybe even just an outdoor fireplace would suffice.
    -Or could get a stove like this: http://vermontwoodstove.com

-Another idea is to get only devices that can plug directly into DC power, so they can be plugged directly into solar panels without the need for the expensive inverter.  You can get fridges like this e.g. http://www.bensdiscountsupply.com/sundanzer-DCR50-refrigerator.aspx.  With fridges it's also possible to avoid the use of batteries by just having cooling occur when there's enough sunlight - this would probably suffice to keep most food cool, especially non-meat.  You can also get solar chargers intended for a laptop or phone, which normally operate on DC power (hence the AC adapter needed to plug them into the wall).  Those might be sufficient.

Conclusion: the only thing that may be worth getting now is a solar water heater.  It may be best to wait until my existing one wears out, then replace it with a solar one.  At that point it may be worth switching to solar + wood heating.
If I'm moving to a new house in the country and starting from scratch, the ideal is a tiny passive house with solar water heating and off-grid solar panels, since I'd expect that the remaining electricity use once I get rid of heat and water heating would cause the monthly fee on an electric bill to be the greatest part of the bill.

2nd conclusion Sep 2014:
Actually I read that solar water heaters have been surpassed by the use of solar panels with an electric heater to heat water.
So a passive house with solar panels seems best.

Looked up how much sunshine Fredericton gets and it looks like it gets a fair bit:

Aug 2015, considering getting solar panels prior to selling house:
-It seems that grid-tied inverters also have a max wattage rating.  So it might not be a good idea because I wouldn't get the right amount of solar panels for the person that buys my house.
-However, it seems like you can use multiple small inverters.  So you can have some things connected directly to the solar panels with DC and other things connected through an inverter of the appropriate size with AC.
-Another idea: is it possible to use only low-wattage devices to cook, such as a slow cooker?  Then I could probably get by without a large inverter.
