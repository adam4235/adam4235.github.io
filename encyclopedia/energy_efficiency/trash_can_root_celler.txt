To refridgerate food without electricity, especially vegetables and other things that don't require a specific temperature:

In the past, people used a root celler.  But if you don't have an unfinished basement, you can make a smaller "root celler":

The Trash Can Root Cellar

A simple, inexpensive way to store small quantities of vegetables is to use a trash can as a root cellar.

You will need to dig a hole deep enough to fit nearly the entire trash can. Buy a galvanized steel trash can and drill holes into the bottom of it (to allow moisture from the surrounding soil into the can). Put the can into the hole, with about three to four inches of it sticking up above the surface of the ground. Plop in the vegetables and secure the lid (you might need to bungee it closed if you have raccoons). Top with a 12-inch layer of straw or leaves and a tarp.
