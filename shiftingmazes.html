	<h1>Shifting Mazes</h1>
	<p>
		Shifting Mazes is a QBasic game I wrote in high school.  It is an RPG (role-playing game), more specifically a randomized dungeon explorer.  It doesn't have proper graphics but is completely done using ASCII characters, in true DOS fashion, and it doesn't have a story either.  Nevertheless, I find it to be very fun.
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll need QBasic to be able to play it, which is an old DOS program.  On Linux you can play it with dosbox and the QBasic executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wrote Shifting Mazes in high school, so don't take the quality of the code as being indicative of my programming abilities.  Yes, it is probably not top-quality code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started making a sequel which was relatively close to completion, but I haven't worked on it for a few years.  If you want a copy of this incomplete, non-working sequel for some reason, you can request it by <a href="email.html">e-mail</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may use, distribute, etc. the code in any way you want, except you may not call it your own or copyright it yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="sm1.zip">Download Shifting Mazes with source code</a> (in the QBasic world, the source code and the program are the same thing)
	</p>
    To use in DosBox under Linux or Windows:
    <ul>
        <li>Install dosbox</li>
        <li>Get the qbasic executable and put it in the same folder as the game (available from <a href="https://www.qbasic.net">https://www.qbasic.net</a>)</li>
        <li>Extract the game's files to a folder, say ~/dosprogs</li>
        <li>Run dosbox</li>
        <li>Enter the commands:
            <pre>
mount c ~/dosprogs
C:
qbasic.exe /run maze.bas
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why haven't you compiled it to an exe?</h2>
    </h2>
    <p>I attempted to compile the game using QuickBasic 4.5.  Although it will run under QuickBasic 4.5, it gave errors when trying to compile it to an exe.  I think the program is too big for QuickBasic 4.5 (QBasic 1.1 is actually a newer program, made in 1991, whereas QuickBasic 4.5 was made in 1988.  But QuickBasic 4.5 is the only one that can compile an exe).</p>
    <p>I also tried using QB64.org, which is a newer open-source compiler, but unfortunately my game uses some obscure statements that QB64 doesn't support (PLAY OFF).</p>
    <p>If anyone wants to try compiling it or has suggestions, it would be appreciated.</p>
