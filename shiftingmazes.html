	<h1>Shifting Mazes</h1>
	<p>
		Shifting Mazes is a QBasic game I wrote in high school.  It is an RPG (role-playing game), more specifically a randomized dungeon explorer.  It doesn't have proper graphics but is completely done using ASCII characters, in true DOS fashion, and it doesn't have a story either.  Nevertheless, I find it to be very fun.
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll need QBasic to be able to play it, which is an old DOS program.  On Linux you can play it with dosbox and the QBasic executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wrote Shifting Mazes in high school, so don't take the quality of the code as being indicative of my programming abilities.  Yes, it is probably not top-quality code.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started making a sequel which was relatively close to completion, but I haven't worked on it for a few years.  If you want a copy of this incomplete, non-working sequel for some reason, you can request it by <a href="email.html">e-mail</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may use, distribute, etc. the code in any way you want, except you may not call it your own or copyright it yourself.

    To use in DosBox under Linux:
    <ul>
        <li>Install dosbox</li>
        <li>Extract the game's files to a folder, say ~/dosprogs</li>
        <li>Run dosbox</li>
        <li>Enter the commands:
            <pre>
mount c ~/dosprogs
C:
qbasic.exe /run maze.bas
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
