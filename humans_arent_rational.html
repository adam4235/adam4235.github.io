	<h1>Humans Aren't Rational</h1>
	<p>
		A few years ago, after years of trying to understand why humans act the way they do, I have been forced to conclude that, in general, humans aren't rational.  That's not to say that they <i>can't</i> be rational - just that, if you happen to see a human acting rationally, it's only by coincidence.
	</p>
	<p>
		If humans were rational, why would they go to the gym, jog for 20 minutes, and then drive to work?  Why would they claim they believe one thing but then act in a way that contradicts that belief?  Why would they stick bits of paper in their mouths and light them on fire?  How could ridiculous advertisements convince them that they should buy product X rather than product Y?  <i>Why would they use Windows?</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		I used to think the strange actions of humans could be explained by selfishness; in other words, people do what benefits them most without regard for others.  But then I realized that this still doesn't explain many actions - most, in fact, of the above examples.
	</p>
	<p>
		The actual cause of human behavior, I am forced to conclude, is feelings.  Humans do what they <i>feel</i> like doing.  This is a product of their genetic makeup combined with influences from other people and from society as a whole.  Occasionally, someone will feel like being rational - but those people are few and far between.
	</p>
	<p>
		But there is hope even for humans.  We can <i>choose</i> to overcome this irrational self.  We, our real selves (souls), can go against that genetic makeup and those external influences and be rational.  You can <i>choose</i> to go against everything that humankind has ever stood for.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dare to be rational.
