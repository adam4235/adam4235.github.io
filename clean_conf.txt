Wash pillows.  Polyester-filled pillows can go in the washing machine normally.  Cotton / feather one can too but have to be dried right away, so if you don't have a drier it has to be a hot sunny day, and they should be washed with one other pillow and nothing else in the washing machine.  365 105
