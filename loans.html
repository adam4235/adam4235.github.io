    <h1>Loans script</h1>
    <p>
        Loans is a program to do loan calculations, useful if you lend people money.  It takes as input some information about the loan and when amounts have been paid back, and generates a "bank statement" showing interest accumulated and the amount still owed.  It can also show the amount of interest accumulated in a particular year, for tax purposes.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        It takes a plain text file as input, so to run it from a Linux terminal you would use a command like the following:
    </p>
<pre>
loans.pl loan.txt 
</pre>
    <p>
    where loan.txt is your input file.  An example input file to specify a $10000 loan at 3% interest per year compounded quarterly might look something like this:
    </p>
<pre>
InterestRate 3
10000 05-May-2017
PaidBack 300 01-Jan-2018
PaidBack 200 01-Feb-2018
</pre>
    <p>
    The PaidBack lines mean $300 was repaid on Jan 1 and $200 was repaid on Feb 1.  It produces output looking like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
InterestRate 3
10000 05-May-2017
Interest 75.56
10075.56 05-Aug-2017
Interest 76.13
10151.69 05-Nov-2017
PaidBack 300 01-Jan-2018
9851.69 01-Jan-2018
PaidBack 200 01-Feb-2018
9651.69 01-Feb-2018
Interest 75.78
9727.47 05-Feb-2018
Interest 71.1
9798.57 05-May-2018
Interest 74.04
9872.61 05-Aug-2018
Interest 74.6
9947.21 05-Nov-2018
Interest 59.64
10006.85 17-Jan-2019
    </pre>
    <p>
        Interest lines show interest accumulated on a particular date.  By default, interest is compounded quarterly.  The end of the input shows the current value of the loan, including any partial interest earned since the last compounding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The input file can also specify regular (recurring) payments.  For example, input like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
InterestRate 3
10000 05-May-2017
PayBackRegular 200 01-Feb-2018
    </pre>
    <p>
    means "starting on Feb 1 2018, pay back $200 per month on the loan".  This avoids having to type out lots of PaidBack lines in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also show the interest accumulated in a particular year, for tax purposes.  For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
loans.pl -t 2018 loan.txt
    </pre>
    <p>
        shows the interest earned in the year 2018.
