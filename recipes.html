	<h1>My recipes</h1>
	<p>I've put my recipes here so that when I go on trips and have to cook I can still get to them.  But you're free to use them if you want.  They can be viewed with any text editor (e.g. Wordpad on Windows).  They might look a bit weird because they're meant to be both human readable and processed with a program I made.  (Which you can get <a href="recipe_instructions.html">here</a>)</p>

	<p>Click <a href="recipes/">here</a> for the recipes.</p>
