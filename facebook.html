	<h1>My "Facebook" profile</h1>
	<p><a href="whynotfacebook.html">Here's why</a> this is here instead of on Facebook.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Interests:</b></p>

<p>comedy, discussions [about philosophy, religions, physics, economics, math], board games, video games, sports, inventing games, teaching, reading, writing, anime, dance dance revolution, just dance, farmer's markets, gadgets, hiking, ping pong, weird people, fantasy, science fiction, house design / home automation, children, downhill skiing, orienteering, sledge hockey, hockey, squash, tennis, badminton, soccer, zipline, bubble soccer, dodgeball</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Religious views:</b>Beliefwise, the closest description I can think of to my beliefs is Mennonite Freethinker.  Mennonites are a Christian denomination that believe in nonretaliation and environmentalism.  Freethinking means to base your beliefs on logic and science rather than religious dogma.  I don't think God cares whether you believe in him, only about your inner state.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Philosophical views:</b></p>

<p>
I'm an idealist rather than a pragmatist.  Regarding free will, I believe in both predestination and free will.  Epistemologically I adhere to the methods of reason, science, and faith.  Regarding when to commit to belief, I'm a sceptic.  I believe in an absolute morality which originates from God and is made known through our conscience and sometimes through revelation.  I'm an anti-modern and anti-postmodern rationalist.  Theologically, I'm a theist of the natural theology (St. Thomas of Aquinas) variety.  Regarding the nature of reality, I'm a dualist.  Regarding the meaning of life, I believe it's to do what's right without regard to personal happiness for the purpose of producing a change in your soul that lasts for an eternity whose purpose is happiness.  Regarding lifestyle, I'm an environmentalist and anti-consumerist.  Regarding public policy, I believe in a free market with restrictions to prevent unfairness.  Regarding the theory of moral value, I believe all things with souls have intrinsic value, and therefore all living things potentially have intrinsic value.  (That includes fetuses, and that is <i>not</i> a religious issue.)  Regarding reproduction, I believe that there are too many people in the world, so we should adopt children rather than have children.  Regarding technology, I'm a minimalist.  Regarding beauty, I believe it's relative (only exists for humans, and nothing higher).  Regarding the social sciences, I believe that humans aren't rational, and therefore their behaviour is impossible to predict and any claim made about their behaviour is meaningless.
</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Political views:</b> libertarian (the belief that the government should prevent unfairness, and not do anything else).</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Relationship status:</b> Single.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>About me:</b></p>

<p>
What is "me"? By "me" do you mean that point of view from which experiences come, or do you mean the personality of the person who happens to be the subject of those experiences? If the former, then I say that "me" is one of the stronger arguments against materialism. If the latter, I don't believe in personalities.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>About you:</b></p>

<p>I think you're all cool but I can't figure out why you act fake, why you call me up on the phone to try to get me to subscribe to credit cards, or why you're so, so wrong.</p>

<p>
"There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done'; and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'" - C.S. Lewis (The Great Divorce)<br />
<br />
"You spoony bard!" - Tellah to Edward in the Super NES version of Final Fantasy 4 (then called FF2)<br />
<br />
"'I will begin to worry about my philosophy', said Mr. Street, 'when Mr. Chesterton has given us his.' It was perhaps an incautious suggestion to make to a person only too ready to write books upon the feeblest provocation." - G.K. Chesterton (Orthodoxy), who wrote about 80 books during his life<br />
<br />
"People have fallen into a foolish habit of speaking of orthodoxy as something heavy, humdrum, and safe. There never was anything so perilous or so exciting as orthodoxy. It was sanity: and to be sane is more dramatic than to be mad." - G.K. Chesterton (Orthodoxy)<br />
<br />
"And, in fact, we find that the more a cultivated reason devotes itself to the aim of enjoying life and happiness, the further does man get away from true contentment. Because of this there arises in many persons, if only they are candid enough to admit it, a certain degree of misology, i.e. hatred of reason." - Immanuel Kant (Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals)<br />
<br />
"Surely every man walks to and fro--like a shadow in a pantomime; surely for futility and emptiness he is in turmoil" - Psalm 39:6 (Amplified Bible)<br />
<br />
"You cannot serve both God and Money." - Jesus (Matthew 6:24)<br />
<br />
"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" - Matthew 5:44<br />
<br />
"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind" - Romans 12:2<br />
<br />
"The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult, and left untried." - G.K. Chesterton<br />
<br />
"The explosion was now officially designated an 'Act of God'. But, thought Dirk, what god? And why?" - Douglas Adams (The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul)<br />
<br />
"If you were not quite yourself when you climbed the wall last night ... then <i>who were you, - and why?</i>" - Douglas Adams (Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency)<br />
<br />
"Don't do anything, and you'll be a good dog." - Snoopy in a Peanuts comic by Charles Shultz<br />
<br />
"The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of childhood into maturity." - Thomas Huxley<br />
<br />
"Atheism is an urban phenomenon." - Bernard Boyd<br />

Me: "Bye Robbie, thanks for being born."<br />

[It's funnier if you're religious.]<br />
<br />
"Your man has become accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn't think of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false' but as 'academic' or 'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'. Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church. Don't waste time trying to make him think that materialism is <i>true</i>! Make him think it is strong, or stark, or courageous - that is the philosophy of the future. That's the sort of thing he cares about." - C.S. Lewis (The Screwtape Letters)<br />
<br />
"Professor Openshaw always lost his temper, with a loud bang, if anybody called him a spiritualist; or a believer in spiritualism. This, however, did not exhaust his explosive elements; for he also lost his temper if anybody called him a disbeliever in spiritualism ... But woe to the simple-minded and innocent materialist ... who, presuming on this narrative tendency, should advance the thesis that ghosts were against the laws of nature, or that such things were only old superstitions ... Him would the professor, suddenly reversing all his scientific batteries, sweep from the field with a cannonade of unquestionable cases and unexplained phenomenon, of which the wretched rationalist had never heard in his life, giving all the dates and details, stating all the attempted and abandoned natural explanations; stating everything, indeed, except whether he, John Oliver Openshaw, did or did not believe in spirits; and that neither spiritualist nor materialist could ever boast of finding out." - G.K. Chesterton (The Blast of the Book)<br />
<br />
"I foresee two possibilities. One -- coming face-to-face with herself 30 years older would put her into shock, and she'd simply pass out, or two -- the encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe!" - Back to the Future 2<br />
<br />
"Sometimes the appropriate response to reality is to go insane." - Philip K. Dick<br />
<br />
"There are three ways to tell the true nature of a person.<br />
1) Live with them for a year.<br />
2) Hold them, upside down and by the legs, over an active volcano.<br />
3) Read their Perl code." - Gaelan<br />
<br />
"People generally quarrel because they cannot argue." - G.K. Chesterton<br />
<br />
"I feel it is my bounden duty to point out that 100 is *not* a "round" number. It is, however, a SQUARE number." - some girl named Sarah<br />
<br />
<p>
A young man was taking his final exam at the police academy when he reached the following question:</p>

<p>You are on patrol downtown when an explosion occurs in a gas main in a nearby street. On investigation you find that a large hole has been blown in the sidewalk and there is an overturned van lying nearby. Inside the van there is a strong smell of alcohol. Both occupants--a man and a woman--are injured. You recognize the woman as the wife of the Chief of Police, who is away at a conference. A driver stops to offer you assistance and you realize that he is a man who is wanted for armed robbery. Suddenly a man runs out of a nearby house, shouting that his wife is expecting a baby and that the shock of the explosion has made her go into labor. Another man is crying for help, having been blown into an adjacent canal by the explosion, and he cannot swim. Describe in a few words what actions you would take.</p>

<p>The police candidate thought for a moment, picked up his pen, and wrote: "I would take off my uniform and mingle with the crowd."</p>
<br />

<p>"In the only world they know, an endless prattling 'Jolly' replaces the intercourse of minds.... Talk, by all means; the more of it the better; unceasing cascades of the human voice; but not, please, a subject." - C.S. Lewis (The Four Loves)</p>

<p>"Do not do unto others as you would have others do unto you; they may have different taste." - George Bernard Shaw
</p>

<p>"Without logic, reason is useless.  With it, you can win arguments and alienate multitudes." - Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein (Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar: Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes)</p>

<p>"When a person at last understands the world as it truly is, they have but 2 appropriate responses to give it.  To seek what meagre happiness can be found in transitory pleasures; or, in defiance, to give up their life in the hope of improving it.  The one who is content with the world as it is is either a liar or insane." - me</p>

<p>
"'After all, they were divinely commanded to "go forth, be fruitful, and multiply."'"
</p><p>
"'You mean their tribal antecedents were so commanded.  Four thousand years ago.  Before a person had to stand in line for an hour and a half just to get a whiff of fresh air.  It's tough to say who's a greater threat to the world, an ambitious CEO with a big ad budget or a crafty cleric with an obsolete Bible verse.'"
-Tom Robbins (Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates, pg 240)
</p>

<p>
"Well <i>that's</i> a semantically null sentence." - Sheldon from Big Bang Theory
</p>

<p>
"If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything." - Mark Twain
</p>

<p>
"Some people say the glass is half full, others say the glass is half empty.  Adam says, 'Why did they make the glass twice as big as it needs to be?'" - my mom
</p>

<p>
"If we cannot be true to ourselves,
then what is it in us that remains?
If we cannot utter what we believe,
then what is [life]? It is
then a prison of the mind and soul."
- my dad

<p><b>Favourite programming language:</b></p>
<p>
I dislike every programming language I've ever used.  My least hated is probably either C++ or D, but I've never used D so it's hard to tell.  The philosophy of C++ almost exactly matches mine, but in terms of details it has many problems and annoyances, largely due to the requirement for backwards compatibility.
