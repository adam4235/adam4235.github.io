1 6_oz_cake compressed fresh yeast
1 c milk
2.25 c all-purpose flour
2 tsp salt
1 # egg
0.75 c currants
0.75 c raisins
1 # Granny Smith apple
1 quart vegetable oil
1 c confectioners' sugar

-Peel & chop the apple (could the peel be left on?)
-Heat the milk until it's lukewarm
-Break up the compressed yeast.  Stir into the warm milk.  
-Let stand for a few minutes to dissolve.
-Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl.
-Stir the yeast mixture and egg into the flour and mix into a smooth batter.
-Stir in the currants, raisins & apple.
-Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise until double in size (about an hour).
-Heat the oil in a deep fryer, or heavy deep pan, to 375F.  Shape scoops of dough into balls (2 metal spoons?), and drop carefully into hot oil.
-Fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes.  They should be soft and not greasy.  If the oil isn't hot enough, the outside will be tough and the insides greasy.  
-Drain finished doughnuts on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar.
