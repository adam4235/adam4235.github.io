INGREDIENTS
   2 pounds LARGE shrimp, uncooked, pull the skin/tails off
   1 finely chopped onion
   1 cup olive oil
   1 tsp sugar
   1 tsp cayenne peper
   1/2 tsp salt
   1/2 tsp oregano
   1 tsp garlic powder
   1/4 cup Maple Syrup
   Optionally a pound-o-bacon


DIRECTIONS
   In a large bowl, mix everything togather (except bacon) and then add shrimp.
   Leave it in the fridge overnight (PREFERABLE) or at least for several hours.
   Flip occasionally to distribute shrimp marinade. Pull out from fridge an hour
   or so beforehand to let things warm/loosen up a bit.

   The next day, preheat your bbq grill while skewering the shrimp.
   Optionally place flat on a fine-screen mesh cookware - less work!
   Wrap in bacon and grill. Be careful about flames from the dripping marinade.
   Serve over rice, pasta, or as-is ... but be sure to drip some marinade on 'em!

   ALEK NOTE: Even without bacon, this bbq shrimp rocks!
