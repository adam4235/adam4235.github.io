Try mom's recipe
Tried "False Cabbage Rolls" with tomato sauce instead of soup and no sour cream.  Forgot to add rice and added too much water I think.



INGREDIENTS:

    * 1 pound lean ground beef
    * 1 onion, sliced
    * 1 medium head cabbage, sliced
    * 2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup
    * 10 3/4 fluid ounces water
    * salt to taste
    * ground black pepper to taste
    * 1/2 cup sour cream

DIRECTIONS:

   1. In a large pot over medium heat, brown the ground beef and onion; drain fat.
   2. Stir in sliced cabbage, tomato soup, water (use the empty soup can to measure), salt, and pepper. Cover and simmer until cabbage is tender; stirring occasionally. Stir in sour cream just before serving.
