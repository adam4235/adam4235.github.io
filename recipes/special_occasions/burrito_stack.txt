1 lb ground beef
1 # onions
2 cloves garlic
3 tsp chili powder
.5 tsp oregano 
.25 tsp cayenne
.25 tsp salt
1 can(540ml) red kidney beans
.25 c salsa
4 # flour tortillas
1 c cheese

Chop the onion and garlic.
Grate the cheese.
If using less than 4 tortilla shells, cut them in half/quarters to make 4 of them.
Brown the beef in a frying pan.
Add onion and garlic when it's browned and brown them too.
Add the chili powder, oregano and cayenne, cook for 2 more minutes.
Put the kidney beans in a drainer and wash them.
Put them in a large bowl and mash them.
Add the salsa and stir a bit.
Add the meat mixture and mix it all together by stirring.
Place 1 tortilla shell on a rimmed baking sheet (fairly deep).
Put 1/3 of the mixture on it,  then 1/4 of the cheese on that.
Add another tortilla, and keep doing this to make layers - 3 layers of meat mixture.
Put 1/4 of the cheese on top.
Bake at 450F for about 10 minutes (until a bit after the tortillas get  brown on the outside).
