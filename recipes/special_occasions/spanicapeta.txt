1 pkg puff pastry (dough)
0.5 lb feta cheese
1-2 c cottage cheese (probably 1.5-2 c I would prefer)
3 # eggs
1 package spinach (1/2 pound)

First, Have to let the puff pastry sit for a couple hours at room temperature to defrost.

Then:
-steam spinach - wash, put in pot without water, heat for 2-3 minutes
-preheat oven to 400F
-mix feta and cottage cheese and eggs
-spread 1/2 of dough in pan
-layer on cheese mixture, then spinach, then cheese mixture
-top with dough
-Bake at 400F 20-30 min (until golden brown on top) (it took me longer than 30 minutes)
