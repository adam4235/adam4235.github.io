2 c flour
1 tsp salt
1 # eggs
.67 c water
4 strips bacon
4 # potatoes (use baking potatoes - long and skinny - if available)
1 shredded_c cheddar cheese
.25 tsp salt
.25 tsp pepper
1 bit milk

1. Make mashed potatoes: peel the potatoes while putting them in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, simmer for about 20 min. or until tender.
2. While potatoes are cooking, fry <bacon>.
3. While bacon and potatoes are cooking, make dough: beat an egg in a large mixing bowl, then combine ingredients 1-4 in the bowl.  Stir to make a ball of dough.
4. Shred the cheese
5. Add milk to potatoes and mash.
6. Crumble the bacon - best way is probably in a plastic bag with a rolling pin.
7. Add the bacon, cheese, salt and pepper to potatoes and stir to make the inner mixture.
8. Roll out the dough, putting flour on the counter first to avoid sticking and more of a mess.  Roll it out with a rolling pin.  It can't be too thin, otherwise the inside of the perogies will leak out when boiling; but it can't be too thick or there'll be too much leftover inner mixture.  Cut out circles or squrares with a container or glass, then put a spoonful of inner mixture on it and fold it into a perogy, pinching the edges to seal it.
9. Bring a pot of boiling water to a boil (not too full of water, because the perogies raise the water level).
10. Add the perogies to the water and boil for 4-5 minutes, or until they float.
