-Gradually mix in water
-Heat a non-stick frying pan to very hot (5 on my induction plate), without oil
-Roll into 6 balls
-Roll a bit of flour on the outside of each one
-Roll out each ball very thin
-Fry each one on each side for about 10-30 seconds (flip when it starts bubbling)
-To make them more pliable when ready to reheat them, wet a paper towel (there are reusable paper towels that are ideal for this) and put it on the tortilla and put it in the microwave for about 45 seconds at 600W.
