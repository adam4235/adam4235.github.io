1 lb ground beef
1 # onion

Frying pan
Heat-resistant Spatula
Large heat-resistant spoon
Small plate

-Microwave the ground beef on the defrost setting to defrost it, if it was in the freezer (better is to take it out and put it in the fridge beforehand).
-Put it in the pan and turn on the heat to medium (about 5 or 6)
-Break it up with the spatula
-Keep cooking it by breaking it up and moving it around. When the redness seems gone, switch to using the big spoon and move it around for a bit more, to make sure it's completely cooked (must watch out for raw meat)
