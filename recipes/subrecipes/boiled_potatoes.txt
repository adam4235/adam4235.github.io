1 # potatoes

-Scrub the potatoes and cut off the bad parts
-Put them in a pot (pasta pro preferred) with water almost covering them
-Boil rapidly on maximum heat, then simmer for ~20 min on lower heat but keep them boiling rapidly
-If they're soft when poked with a fork, they're done; otherwise, keep boiling
-Drain
-Turn heat to low and put them back on, with the lid of the pot, for ~5 minutes.  This isn't strictly necessary but apparently makes them taste better.
