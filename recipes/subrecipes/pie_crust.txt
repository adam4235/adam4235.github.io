0.9 c shortening
0.25 c water
1 tbsp milk
2.25 c flour
0.5 tsp salt

-Boil water
-Microwave shortening in a large bowl for a short time.  Keep the paper from the shortening (to be used later)
-Pour hot water and milk over shortening
-With a dinner fork, break up the shortening
-Tilt bowl and mix quickly until it looks like whipped cream (takes a little while and may never really happen)
-Pour flour and salt over shortening mixture, a bit at a time, and keep mixing until you get dough that cleans the bowl.  Can eventually start mixing with your hands.
-Divide into 2 parts (top and bottom of pie)
-Roll out into 2 circles, putting flour on the counter and rolling pin to prevent it from sticking
-Rub shortening from the paper onto pie plate
-Put bottom in pie plate
-Put whatever goes in the pie on top
-Put the top on that

This recipe (as I originally wrote it) makes the right amount for an 8" or 9" pie plate.
