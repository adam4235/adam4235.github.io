0.5 c baking powder
0.25 c sugar
9 c flour
1.25 c canola oil
1 tbsp salt

-(I added the salt, based on the more-with-less Master Baking Mix recipe)
-Mix dry ingredients
-gradually mix in vegetable oil (recipe suggests "Cut the oil into the mixture with a pastry blender. Do this until it has the consistency of corn meal."  But I just usually mix it with a fork / spoon)
