1 c noodles
4 c water

Note: The package says 1L per 100g of noodles, and I think 1c is about 100g.

Boil the water to a rolling boil WITHOUT PUTTING THE NOODLES IN FIRST!
Add pasta.
Stir until water returns to a boil.
Cook, stirring occasionally, (with no lid?) 6-8 minutes (longer means softer).
Drain.
