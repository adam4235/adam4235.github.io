prep.:30 min
cook:10 min

400 ml All-purpose (white) flour
75 ml Cocoa
1 tsp Baking soda
0.5 tsp salt
1 c Margerine
0.75 c packed brown sugar
0.5 c white sugar
1 # eggs
2 tsp vanilla (or vanilla extract)
1 c chocolate chips
1 c white chocolate chips (or regular chocolate chips)
1 c coarsely chopped pecans

-Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.  Set them aside.
-Put margerine in a LARGE, microwaveable bowl.
-Microwave for 30 s on pwr 70% of 1100W.
-Cream with an electric mixer (or with a normal spoon, but this takes a long time).  Do this until it's light.
-Gradually mix in brown and white sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth.
-Mix in dry ingredients on low speed.  Mix well.
-Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
-Heat oven to 375F
-Drop dough by spoonfuls, 5 cm apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
-Bake for 8-10 min, or until set.  Don't put 2 pans into the oven at once since the heat won't circulate properly and the bottoms won't brown.
-Cool on the baking sheets for 1 min, then, if the baking sheets are ones that things easily stick to, put them on plates or something to cool completely.  Don't pile up the cookies when they're cooling or they'll combine.

Note: To get coarsely chopped pecans from pecans, put them on a cutting board and use a large knife, pushing the knife down with your hand from the top to prevent cutting yourself.  Cut horizonally then vertically to get a good coarseness.
