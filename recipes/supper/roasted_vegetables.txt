2 # carrots
1 bunch beets
1 # onions
2 # potatoes
1 # squash
2 # sweet potatoes
2 cloves garlic
1 bunch oil

-Chop the vegetables into good-sized chunks, putting them on a baking sheet.  (Leave the garlic as whole cloves.)  
-Preheat oven to 400F.  
-Brush the vegetables with oil on both sides.  
-Optionally add 1 tbsp dried herbs or 3 tbsp fresh herbs such as rosemary, thyme, parsley, oregano
-Bake for 50 min, flipping partway through.  Garlic takes less time, and might be best left out.  Onions also may take less time.

Note: original recipe had parsnips and turnips, but I don't like those
