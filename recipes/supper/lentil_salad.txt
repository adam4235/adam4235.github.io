2 c lentils
1 # bay leaf
1 clove garlic
2 # leeks
3 # carrots
0.5 # onion
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp oil
1 bit black pepper
1 tbsp parsley

-Rinse lentils
-Boil lentils in a pot with lots of water for 10 min
-Chop garlic, add it and bay leaf to lentils
-Heat up some oil in a frying pan
-Chop leeks (removing large part of the stalk) and clean well, and chop carrots and onion, adding them to be fried
-Fry vegetables until translucent, about 4-5 min
-Put vegetables and other ingredients in a bowl, mix together
-After lentils have boiled for 10 min, uncover and keep boiling for 15-20 more minutes or longer, or until tender

Note: Original recipe had 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, but it tastes fine (maybe better) without it, and is probably better for my acid reflux.  It also had more salt.
The bay leaf doesn't seem to be necessary.
