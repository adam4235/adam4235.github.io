2 c lentils
1 # bay leaf OR
1 bit nothing
1 clove garlic
2 # leeks
3 # carrots
0.5 # onion
0.5 tsp salt
3 tbsp oil
0.25 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp parsley

-Rinse lentils
-Boil lentils and bay leaf in a pot with lots of water (2:1 ratio of water:lentils is probably best) for 10 min, or in instant pot for 15 min
-Chop vegetables
-Fry leeks and garlic in a bit of water (this prevents it from being too strong, I think, which it was when I put the leeks in raw) - don't put them in the same pot as the lentils (it was mushy when I tried this before)
-Mix everything in a bowl
-If not using instant pot, after lentils have boiled for 10 min, uncover and keep boiling for 15-20 more minutes or longer, or until tender

Note: Original recipe had 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, but it tastes fine (maybe better) without it, and is probably better for my acid reflux.  It also had more salt.
The bay leaf doesn't seem to be necessary.  Original recipe said to fry the vegetables in oil.
