2 c lentils
1 # bay leaf
1 clove garlic
2 # leeks
3 # carrots
0.5 # onion
1 tsp salt
4 tbsp oil
1 bit black pepper
1 tbsp parsley

-Rinse lentils
-Boil lentils in a pot with lots of water for 10 min, or in instant pot for 15 min
-Chop vegetables
-Put vegetables and other ingredients in a bowl, mix together
-If not using instant pot, after lentils have boiled for 10 min, uncover and keep boiling for 15-20 more minutes or longer, or until tender

Note: Original recipe had 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, but it tastes fine (maybe better) without it, and is probably better for my acid reflux.  It also had more salt.
The bay leaf doesn't seem to be necessary.  Original recipe said to fry the vegetables in oil.
