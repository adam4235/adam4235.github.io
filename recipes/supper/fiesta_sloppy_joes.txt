1 lb ground beef
1 # onion
1 # green pepper
1 cloves garlic
0.75 c rice
0.25 tsp dry mustard
0.25 tsp celery seed
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp maple syrup
0.25 tsp chili powder
500 ml tomato sauce

-Fry the ground beef.  Best to use a non-stick frying pan because otherwise the rice and meat get horribly stuck.
-Cook the rice, at least partly, in a pressure cooker or pot
-Chop the onion, green pepper and garlic
-Add them to the ground beef once it's browned
-Add everything to the frying pan, stir together, cover, boil, simmer 25 minutes WITHOUT STIRRING if using white rice, longer for brown rice

Note: original recipe had Worcestershire sauce.  I replaced it with more sugar and salt, and it still tasted great.
