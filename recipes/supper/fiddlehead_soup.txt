4 tbsp oil
2 # onion
2 cloves garlic
2 lb fiddleheads
4 # potatoes
6 # soup cubes

-Wash fiddleheads.  Boil for a few minutes, then drain.  (This removes brown dirt and seems to improve the taste a lot.)
-chop onion, mince garlic
-dice potatoes
-In large saucepan over medium heat, add oil
-Add onions; cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. 
-Add garlic and fiddleheads; cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. 
-Stir in rest of ingredients
-Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes.
-Blend with hand blender (blender or food processor makes it splatter) until smooth.
-Optionally garnish each serving with a sprinkle of chives.
