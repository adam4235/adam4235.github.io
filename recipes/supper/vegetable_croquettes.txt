2 cloves garlic
1.5 c flour
2 tsp salt
0.5 tsp pepper
4 # eggs
0.5 c water
0.5 c vegetable oil

Note: can use a deep fryer for these instead of a frying pan.

-coarsely grate the potatoes
-coarsely grate the carrots
-chop the onions
-mince the garlic
-Beat the eggs
-Heat the oil in a skillet.  WARNING: DON'T USE A MEASURING CUP THAT HAD WATER IN IT!  THAT WILL CAUSE LITTLE EXPLOSIONS AND YOU MIGHT GET SPLASHED WITH HOT OIL!
-make a batter of ingredients 5-9.
-Stir the batter into the vegetables.
-Drop vegetable mixture into hot oil by teaspoons or tablespoons depending on size of croquettes desired.  Fry until  browned on both sides (takes about 3 minute per side).  DON'T PUT A LID ON THE FRYING PAN!  That causes water to drip from it and cause explosions.  Drain on paper towels (otherwise they'll be too fatty).
