2 c black beans
4 tbsp oil
2 # onion
4 cloves garlic
8 tsp cumin
1 bit salt
1 bit black pepper
1 bit cayenne
2 # soup cubes
1 # squash (buttercup, not butternut)
2 tbsp lime juice
1 tbsp parsley
8 # tortillas

-If using dried black beans, soak them overnight, then boil them for quite a while (see more-with-less for how long).  DON'T USE THE PASTA POT - THE WATER WILL ALL BOIL AWAY DUE TO THE HOLES IN THEN TOP AND THEY'LL STICK!!
-peel squash, cut in half and scoop out seeds
-Heat oil in a large skillet or large shallow pot over medium heat.
-dice onion, adding it to the pot.
-cook onion, stirring often, 3-5 minutes or until soft.  Meanwhile:
-mince garlic
-Add garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne.  Cook, stirring, 30 seconds.
-cut up squash
-Add broth (with 1 c water for each cube, I guess - or probably less would be better) and squash.  Boil, and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
-chop parsley (if it's fresh)
-Stir in beans.  Cook, uncovered, until squash is tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2-5 minutes.
-Remove from heat.
-Mash the mixture in the skillet.
-Stir in lime juice and parsley.
-Put in tortillas
-Optionally serve with salsa and/or sour cream and/or cheese.

Next time, try omitting the lime juice - does it taste good?  I think that might be reducing the taste, and is bad for my acid reflux anyway.
