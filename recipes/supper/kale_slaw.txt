3 c cabbage
2.5 c kale
1 # carrot
0.25 # onion
0.25 tsp celery seed
0.33 c cashews OR
0.33 c walnuts OR
0.33 c almonds
0.33 c sunflower seeds
0.33 c water
3 tbsp oil
2 tsp maple syrup - bring jar to market
1 tsp salt
1 tsp paprika
0.75 tsp chili powder
0.125 tsp cayenne
1.5 c walnuts
1 tbsp dry onion

Shred / grate the vegetables, putting them in the bowl.
Add the celery seed, and mix up.
Blend everything else in a food processor.
Mix that into the vegetables.

Note: original recipe had 0.25 tsp chipotle instead of cayenne and 0.25 tsp of the chili powder.  I found it still tasted good with that substitution, and there are no other recipes I have that need chipotle.
Also original had Apple Cider Vinegar
Note: next time try walnuts or almonds instead of cashews, since cashews have ethical issues.
