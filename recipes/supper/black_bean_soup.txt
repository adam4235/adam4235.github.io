Note: original recipe had 2 tsp molasses, but I find it tastes fine without it, and I don't need molasses for anything else
Note: original recipe had Worcestershire sauce.  I added more maple syrup instead.  I tried adding 0.5 tsp of salt too, but it was too salty.
Note: original recipe said fry the vegetables
