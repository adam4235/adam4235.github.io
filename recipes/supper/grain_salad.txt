0.66 c rye kernels
0.66 c oat groats
0.66 c barley
3.5 c water
2 # soup cubes
0.5 # onions
1 # carrots
1 stalks celery
0.5 bunches brocolli
6 # mushrooms
0.125 tsp cayenne
3 cloves garlic
0.25 tsp pepper
0.75 tbsp basil
0.75 tbsp parsely
2 tbsp oil

-Put the grains in a wok or large frying pan and cook them on low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, with no water or anything.  They should pop and smell nutty.
-Cook the grains and soup cubes in the instant pot for 30 min.
-Chop and fry the vegetables in a bit of water, and add the spices.  Do the brocolli first, then the garlic.
-Mix it all together and add oil at the end.

Note: this is a different process than the recipe had, but seems healthier.  (See mom_recipe_originals for original)
