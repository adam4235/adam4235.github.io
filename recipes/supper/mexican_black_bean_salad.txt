1 c black beans
1.5 c corn
0.5 c green onions
1 # avocado
0.5 # red pepper
1 small_head lettuce
1 tbsp coriander (also called cilantro) 
1 tbsp basil
2 tbsp lime juice
1 # jalapeno pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
0.75 tsp maple syrup
1 bit salt
1 bit pepper

Cook beans if dried
Chop everything and mix it in a large bowl, but don't include the seeds of jalapeno pepper to reduce the spiciness.

Note: I tried it without basil and then added the basil, and it tasted slightly better with basil I suppose.
It also tasted good with navy beans instead of black beans.
