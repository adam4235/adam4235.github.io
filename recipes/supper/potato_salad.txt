7 # potatoes
3 # eggs
1 stalks celery
1 # green onion
1 # radish
3 cloves garlic
1 # carrot
0.25 c oil
0.5 tsp salt
0.5 tsp black pepper
1 bit mustard

Step 1: done way before it's time to eat (a few hours or more).
Cook the potatoes (boiled potatoes).  Let them cool.
Put them in the fridge after they're fairly cool.
At the same time that the potatoes are boiling cook the eggs: make hard boiled eggs, but put them in the fridge with the shells on them.

Step 2: done once the potatoes and eggs are cool.
Cut the potatoes into cubes. Put in bowl.
Peel the eggs, washing off the bits of shell, then dice them. Put in bowl.
Chop the vegetables.
Grate the carrot.
mix it all together, except salt - let people put salt on themselves (I think it might not need any).
Refridgerate until it's cool.
