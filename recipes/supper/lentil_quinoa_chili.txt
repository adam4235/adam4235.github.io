2 c kidney beans
2 stalks celery
1 # onion
2 # sweet peppers (any color)
0.33 c quinoa
1.2 c lentils
3 c water
1 # soup cube
1 c corn
3 c tomato sauce
0.5 tsp salt
0.25 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp coriander
0.5 tbsp cumin

Soak kidney beans overnight and cook them in pressure cooker
Chop and saute the celery, onion and peppers in a pot for about 10 min.  Note: you can't use an instant pot for this - it will burn.
Rinse the quinoa and lentils.
Add everything.  Simmer for an hour.

I'm wondering if it might work better to boil everything except tomato sauce and beans first, then add those at the end?  It still got burnt after only 15 minutes even when I just put it in a pot at 2 on my induction plate.
