4 c water
2 # soup cubes
1 # squash (1 squash = 3 cups after chopped up)
3 c corn
1 # onions
1 # red peppers
1 # green peppers
1 # jalapeno pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 tbsp oil
2 tsp paprika
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp oregano
2 c chick peas
1 tbsp basil
1 c tomato sauce
1 bit black pepper

-Soak beans overnight if using dried beans and cook in pressure cooker for 1.5 hours
-Peel and chop the squash
-Place the broth in a large pot with the squash and corn kernels.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and cook for 15 minutes.
-Meanwhile, cut up onion, bell peppers, jalapenos and garlic and sauté pan in the oil.  To avoid it being too spicy, leave out the seeds from the jalapenos - even a few of them make it way too spicy.  Cook, stirring frequently until vegetables soften.  
-Add the paprika, cumin and oregano, continue to cook and stir for about one minute.  Set aside.
-Add everything to the pot
-Heat through

Hints:  In Chile this stew is traditionally made with cranberry beans.  I used canned pinto beans to save some time.  If you can find fresh cranberry beans at your local farmer’s market, buy them and cook until tender, then use in this recipe.  You will need about 3 cups of cooked beans.

Original recipe had hot pepper sauce and red pepper flakes, but when I left them out and put in all the seeds of the jalapeno pepper, it was too spicy.

Is the paprika necessary?  Next time try without it.
