1.5 tbsp parsely

-chop the walnuts
-finely chop the celery and green onion
-mix everything in a large bowl

Note: original recipe had wheat berries instead.  I changed it to use up some oat groats and rye kernels.
Note: the original recipe had dried cherries, but they're too expensive and I don't like them that much.  I replaced them with raisins.
