Note: original recipe had an option for 2 parsnips instead of 2 carrots, but I don't like parsnips.
Note: original recipe had 4 tbsp of lemon juice that gets added when blending, but I found adding lemon juice makes it taste worse.
Note: original recipe had curry powder, but that just means a blend of spices often including cumin and coriander.
