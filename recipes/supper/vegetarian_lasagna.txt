0.66 c almonds OR
0.66 c hazelnuts OR
0.66 c walnuts
0.5 c water
2 tbsp oil
4 cloves garlic
1 lb firm tofu OR
1 lb soft tofu
1.5 tsp basil
1 tsp salt
9 # lasagna noodles
1 jar pasta sauce
2 # onions
2 stalks celery
2 # carrots
10 # mushrooms
1 c corn
1 bag spinach
1 tsp italian herbs

Boil the noodles.
Cut up half the cloves of garlic
Put the nuts, water, oil, and half the cloves of garlic in a food processor.
Crumble the tofu and blend it and the basil and salt in the food processor too (NOT a blender).  If you don't have a food processor, just mix it into the blended mixture with a fork.  This makes a cottage-cheese-like mixture (originally cashew ricotta).
Cut up celery, onions, garlic, add them to be fried
Cut up and add the mushrooms and saute for several minutes.
Dice carrots, add them and the corn, and about 3 tbsp of water, cover and steam until vegetables are tender.
Add spinach and steam until wilted.
Preheat oven to 350F
Layer in a 9x13 lasagna pan, or my 2 large pyrex dishes, 2.6L each (cutting the noodles in half for the pyrex dishes):
1/4 of the pasta sauce
3 noodles
1/4 of the pasta sauce
1/2 of the vegetables
1/2 of the ricotta
3 noodles
1/4 of the pasta sauce
1/2 of the vegetables
1/2 of the ricotta
italian herbs
3 noodles
Brush these noodles with oil to prevent them from getting dry and crunchy
rest of sauce
To prevent the top from getting dry and crunchy, cover it with a metal pan.
Bake for an hour
Note: original recipe said to now remove the cover and bake for 10 more min.  But this makes the top layer crunchy, which I don't like, and I think that was the purpose of those instructions.
Note: The recipe said firm tofu, but is soft OK, since it's being blended?  Next time try with soft tofu.
