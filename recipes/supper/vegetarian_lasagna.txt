0.66 c cashews
0.5 c water
2 tbsp oil
4 cloves garlic
1 lb firm tofu
1.5 tsp basil
1 tsp salt
9 # lasagna noodles
1 jar pasta sauce
2 # onions
2 stalks celery
2 # carrots
10 # mushrooms
1 c corn
1 bag spinach
1 tsp italian herbs

Cut up half the cloves of garlic
Put the cashews, water, oil, and half the cloves of garlic in a food processor.
Crumble the tofu and blend it and the basil and salt in the food processor too (NOT a blender).  If you don't have a food processor, just mix it into the blended mixture with a fork.  This makes a cottage-cheese-like mixture (cashew ricotta).
Boil the noodles.
Cut up celery, onions, garlic, add them to be fried
Cut up and add the mushrooms and saute for several minutes.
Dice carrots, add them and the corn, and about 3 tbsp of water, cover and steam until vegetables are tender.
Add spinach and steam until wilted.
Preheat oven to 350F
Layer in a 9x13 lasagna pan:
1/4 of the pasta sauce
3 noodles
1/4 of the pasta sauce
1/2 of the vegetables
1/2 of the cashew ricotta
3 noodles
1/4 of the pasta sauce
1/2 of the vegetables
1/2 of the cashew ricotta
italian herbs
3 noodles
rest of sauce
Put aluminum foil over it
Bake for an hour, then remove the aluminum foil and bake for 10 more min (save the foil for storing leftovers) NOTE: I usually use another cover instead of aluminum foil, but next time, try skipping 10 min of uncovered baking - it seems to make the top layer of noodles crunchy, which I don't like.

Note: next time try almonds instead of cashews, since cashews have ethical issues.
