4 # sweet potatoes
2 c navy beans
4 tbsp soy sauce - next time try maple syrup and salt, and modify recipe
0.5 c flour
1 # avocado
2 bit oil

-Peel and boil sweet potatoes (about 10 min)
-Mash with kidney beans and avocado
-Add soy sauce, flour, mix together
-Fry in non-stick frying pan with oil in a big mass (orginal recipe said to make patties, but I find that pointless since they don't stay together)
