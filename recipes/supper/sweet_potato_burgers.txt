2 # sweet potatoes
1 c navy beans
0.5 tbsp maple syrup
0.5 tsp salt
1 c flour
0.5 # avocado

-Peel and boil sweet potatoes (about 10 min)
-Mash in pot with kidney beans and avocado
-Add everything else, mix together
-Fry in non-stick frying pan in patties, flipping after about 10 minutes on power 3.  Oil doesn't seem needed if the pan is non-stick, but I think it should have a bit of water added to it instead in that case.

Note: original recipe had 4 tbsp of soy sauce instead of maple syrup and salt.
