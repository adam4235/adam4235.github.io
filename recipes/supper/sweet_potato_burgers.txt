4 # sweet potatoes
2 c navy beans
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp salt
0.5 c flour
1 # avocado
2 bit oil

-Peel and boil sweet potatoes (about 10 min)
-Mash in pot with kidney beans and avocado
-Add everything else, mix together
-Fry in non-stick frying pan with oil in a big mass (orginal recipe said to make patties, but I find that pointless since they don't stay together)

Note: original recipe had 4 tbsp of soy sauce instead of 1 tbsp of maple syrup and 1 tsp of salt.  It could probably use a bit more maple syrup.
