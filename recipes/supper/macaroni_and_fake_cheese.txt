1 tsp salt
8 c macaroni
4 slices bread
0.5 c oil
3 # potatoes
1 # carrots
2 # onions
0.5 c cashews
2 tsp salt
2 cloves garlic
0.5 tsp mustard
2 tbsp lemon juice
0.5 tsp black pepper
0.25 tsp cayenne

-Cook macaroni with salt
-Chop vegetables and boil them for 15 min
-Chop bread in food processor (NOT BLENDER) to make bread crumbs.  Can add 2 tbsp oil to the food processor too.  If you don't have a food processor, dry out the bread overnight, then put it in a bag and roll it with a rolling pin to turn it into crumbs.
-In food processor or blender, add everything else, then add vegetables when cooked, blend until smooth like cheese sauce
-Preheat oven to 350F
-In large bowl, mix noodles and cheese sauce
-Put in baking dish containers, sprinkle bread crumbs on top
-Bake for 30 min, or until golden brown on top

Note: next time try almonds instead of cashews, since cashews have ethical issues.
