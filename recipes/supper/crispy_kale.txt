1 bunches kale
2 tbsp oil

Preheat oven (or toaster oven) to 325F 
Rip off leaves from the kale (leave the stem)
Spin dry the kale
Add it to a metal pan (or 2 pans) - NOT glass pans!  (It doesn't get crispy in glass pans, for some reason.)
Cook for 15-20 min, flipping halfway through

Note: original recipe had nutritional yeast and salt added at the end
