1 # squash

-Slice the squash in half.
-Scoop out the seeds and stringy parts.
-Now there are 3 choices: stovetop, microwave, oven

Stovetop (like mashed potatoes):
-Cut it into slices
-cut the skin off the slices
-wash the slices
-cut them up into chunks
-put them in a pot (Pasta Pro is best) with water not quite covering them
-bring to a boil
-simmer until they are soft when poked (about 10 min)
-drain
-mash it if you want with butter or margarine.

Microwave:
-put on a glass baking dish with the cut side down with 1cm of water
-microwave at 100% of 1100 watts until it is soft when you poke a shishkabob stick through it (about 8 min per half squash)
-scoop out the squash
-mash it if you want with butter or margarine.

Oven:
-place it with the cut side down in a large baking dish with 1cm of water.
-Bake at 375F for 30-45min (until it's soft when you pierce it with a fork).
-scoop out the squash.
-mash it if you want with butter or margarine.
