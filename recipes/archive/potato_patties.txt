2 # potato patties
1 # eggs
1 bit cheese

Put the patties in the toaster oven at 450F.  Cook for ~15 min, flipping after ~8 min (follow directions on package).   Make a scrambled egg - but it will be one big thing in the frying pan.  Cut the egg in half, and put the 2 halves on each patty.  Slice some cheese & put it on the patties as well.  Put it back in the toaster oven until the cheese melts.
