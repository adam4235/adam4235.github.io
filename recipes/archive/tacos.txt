1 lb ground beef
1 # onions
1 cloves garlic
0.33 c tomato paste
0.67 c water
1 tsp chili powder
0.5 tsp oregano
0.25 tsp cumin
1 bit salt
1 bit pepper
1 package taco shells or tortilla wraps
1 bunch lettuce
1 bunch cheese

Cheese grater
Frying pan
Spatula or other plastic chopping tool (for ground beef)
Cutting board
Large knife
Can opener
Large spoon

Chop onion.
Mince garlic.
In large frying pan, cook beef over medium heat until brown.  Add onion & garlic; cook until onion & garlic are soft (tender).

Stir in tomato paste, water, chili powder, oregano, and cumin.  Simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add salt and pepper.  If mixture becomes dry, add water. Shred lettuce, grate cheese, put on as toppings.

Note: last time I made this, I didn't like it.  Maybe I should get a taco sauce instead of tomato paste and extra spices.
