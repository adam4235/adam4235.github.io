Note: original recipe had apple cider vinegar, but it still tasted good without it
Note: original recipe didn't have nutritional yeast.  Is it necessary?
Note: original recipe used bread instead of oatmeal, but it tasted good (probably better) with oatmeal.  However, it didn't stick together very well - try another binder next time?
Try removing ketchup next time?
Note: original recipe had these spices, but I couldn't tell the difference between one with spices and one without:
2 tsp parsley
2 tsp chives
2 tsp chili powder
