cook:15

1 lb ground beef
1 # eggs
0.67 c rolled oats
2 tsp dry minced onions - called "onion" on my spice rack
0.25 c milk
1 tsp parsley
1 tsp salt
1 bit pepper

Dump all ingredients into a large bowl
Get cookie sheet ready - WHICH HAVE EDGES (otherwise the grease will leak off and start a fire)
Preheat oven to 350F.  (Could probably use the toaster oven)
Mix well with your hands.
Shape into small balls and put on the cookie sheets - they don't grow after cooking.
Bake for 20 min, or until they're browned, flipping around at various points (at least once)

Note: to make bread crumbs, dry out some slices of bread then put them in a plastic bag and roll them with a rolling pin.  Can mix in Bran Flakes too.
