Worked OK with hulled tahini (though not much difference with or without tahini): http://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/
This didn't work in the food processor, but it worked in the blender when I added water (it might work in the food processor if I make more - the liquid was below the blades): http://www.inspiredtaste.net/26901/easy-tahini-recipe/

1 can chick peas, drained
0.33 c tahini
0.25 c lemon juice
1 tsp salt
4 cloves garlic
0.5 c olive oil

Cook chickpeas overnight
Add all ingredients to food processor
If it's too dry, keep adding a bit more oil
PUT SOME IN THE FREEZER!  It goes bad after a few weeks in the fridge.
