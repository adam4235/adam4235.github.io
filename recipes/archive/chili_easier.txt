1 cloves garlic
2 stalks celery
1 T chili powder
.5 tsp basil
.5 tsp oregano
700 ml tomato sauce
.5 tsp salt
.25 tsp pepper
1 can kidney beans

-Make fried ground beef
-Cut up celery, onions & garlic
-Add them to the frying pan and fry them too until clear
-Put the kidney beans in the sieve to drain them and then wash them
-Put everything in the pot
-Boil, then simmer while stirring occasionally for about 10-30 minutes

Note: original recipe said 2 or 3 T of chili pepper.  Last time I made it with 2 and I didn't like it.  It may be because I used Pasta Sauce instead of Tomato Sauce.
