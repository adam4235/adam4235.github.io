Hot Water Pastry

It's really hard to ruin this pie crust recipe. It makes the most tender crust you've ever tasted! This recipe works best if you use the waxed paper method for rolling out the dough.

INGREDIENTS:

    * 1 cup minus 2 Tbsp. shortening
    * 1/4 cup hot water
    * 1 Tbsp. milk
    * 2-1/4 cups all purpose flour
    * 1/2 tsp. salt

PREPARATION:
Place shortening in large bowl. Pour hot water and milk over the shortening. With a dinner fork, break up the shortening. Tilt bowl and beat quickly until the mixture looks like whipped cream. Pour flour and salt over shortening mixture and beat well with the fork, forming a dough that cleans the bowl.  Divide into two parts and roll out between two sheets of waxed paper. Fit into pie shell and use as directed in recipe. Makes enough pastry for a filled 2 crust 8" or 9" pie.
