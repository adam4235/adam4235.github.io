1.5 c chick peas
4 cloves garlic
4 tbsp parsley
1.5 tsp cumin
1 tsp salt
1 tsp hot pepper sauce
1 bunch flour
0.25 c oil
1 bunch lettuce
1 bunch hummus
1 bunch tortillas

Cook chickpeas
Mince garlic in food processor (NOT blender)
Blend in food processor everything but flour and oil and lettuce and hummus (can mash with a fork too) - add water (about 1/2 c) if needed to make it work better
Roll into balls (about 2 tbsp each), in flour, and flatten slightly
Heat oil in non-stick frying pan over medium heat
Fry for 10-15 min per side or until golden brown
Put in pitas with hummus and lettuce

Note: original recipe had lemon juice or lime juice, but it still tasted OK without it
Next time try omitting hot sauce too?  Not sure if that causes acid reflux or not.
