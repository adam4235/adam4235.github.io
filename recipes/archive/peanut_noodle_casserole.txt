0.5 c soy sauce
0.25 c rice vinegar
0.66 cup water
2 tbsp maple syrup - bring jar to market
1 tsp salt
1.33 c chunky peanut butter
4 tbsp sesame oil
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp hot pepper sauce
1.5 lb soba noodles
1 bunch green beans
2 # carrots
2 c corn OR
2 # corn_on_the_cob
1 c honey-roasted peanuts
0.66 cup sesame seeds
1 tsp red pepper flakes

-Make the peanut sauce by combining all ingredients up to and including hot pepper sauce in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth.
-Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil and cook noodles until al dante, about 5 minutes.
-In the meantime, cut green beans into 1-inch lengths
-cut carrots into matchsticks
-Add the beans, carrots, and corn to the pasta and continue cooking another 2-3 minutes or until noodles are tender.  (Julie says it usually takes longer for her)
-Drain the pasta and vegetables, but don't rinse.
-Spoon the peanut sauce over the noodles and vegetables.
-Sprinkle with the peanuts, sesame seeds and pepper flakes.

Note: original recipe said maple syrup instead of honey.  It tasted weird last time; try maple syrup instead.  It might also be that I used dry roasted peanuts (as the original recipe said) instead of honey roasted.

Original recipe had dry-roasted peanuts instead of honey-roasted.

tip: the sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.  Also try it as a dipping sauce for fresh spring rolls.

Note: last time tried substituting regular vinegar and olive oil, but it seemed a bit worse.  However, I noticed that the strong taste was soy sauce, so maybe try less soy sauce next time.  The soy sauce I used was Shoyu, which might have a stronger taste.
