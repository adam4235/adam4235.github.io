8 # collard greens leaves
1 c quinoa
1 tbsp peanut butter
1 # carrots
1 chopped_tbsp ginger
1 # shallot
0.5 c soy beans
1 tsp honey
1 tbsp sesame oil
0.25 tsp salt
2 # beets
1 # avocado

-Cook the soy beans
-Wash the quinoa for about 3 minutes with a strainer
-Cook quinoa for 10 min with about twice as much water as quinoa
-Wash the collard green leaves, set aside
-Blend carrots, ginger, shallot, peanut butter, honey and vinegar in food processor
-Add sesame oil and salt and blend them too
-Grate the beets
-Cut up the avocado
-Take 2 collard greens leaves, overlap them halfway to form a larger wrapping area.  Put on them the blended mixture, then the quinoa, then the beets and avocado.  Wrap it up.

Note: can also sprout the quinoa instead of cooking it
Note: original recipe had 1 c sprouts as well
Note: original recipe had miso paste, which I substituted with soy beans.  It also had tahini, which I substituted with peanut butter.  It also had lemon juice and brown rice vinegar, which I left out.  It's also nice to add a bit of another kind of sauce as well (I tried sweet potato dip last time).
