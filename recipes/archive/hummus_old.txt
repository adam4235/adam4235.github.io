2 c chickpeas (uncooked)
2 tbsp lemon juice
4 tbsp olive oil
0.33 c sesame seeds
3 cloves garlic
1 bit salt
1 bit pepper
1 tbsp parsley
1 tsp cumin
0.5 tsp hot sauce
4 tbsp water

Cook chickpeas overnight
Make the tahini by blending sesame seeds in food processor with a bit of oil (blender didn't seem to work).
Add an ingredient at a time, blending for a while - about a minute after each one.  Add water / oil to make it creamier.

Worked OK last time, but still a bit bland.  More spices perhaps?
