1 # salmon filet

-Put the steak in the frying pan with a bit of water, covered.  Boil for a few minutes on medium heat, flip, boil for a few more minutes, remove cover, fry for a few minutes, flip, fry for a few more minutes.  At the end, you should be able to stick a fork into it and it should come out clean.  Salmon should be lighter pink at the end.
-Let it sit for about 2 minutes before cutting it, so the juices are distributed throughout the salmon
