1 c pinto beans
2 c lentils
2 slices bread
3 tsp garlic powder (store in freezer)
2 tsp parsley
2 tsp chives
2 tsp chili powder
2 # soup cubes
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1.5 c ketchup, divided
0.4 lb tofu
4 tbsp oil
2 # green pepper
2 # onion

-Overnight, soak and cook pinto beans for about 2 hours
-Cook the lentils
-Put bread crumbs, dry seasonings, vinegar, 2/3 of the ketchup, tofu, lentils into a large bowl.
-Chop and fry onion and green pepper
-Preheat oven to 375F
-Blend beans in food processor with the rest of the ketchup (or could just mash them in too).  Using a blender instead doesn't work.
-Add mixture to large bowl, along with cooked vegetables.  Mix well.
-Grease baking dishes (bread loaf pans work) and add the mixture to it.
-Bake for 35-40 min.

Note: tried with normal vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.  Still tasted good.  I'm not sure if apple cider vinegar would taste a lot better.
