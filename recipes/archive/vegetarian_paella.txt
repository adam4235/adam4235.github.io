4 tbsp oil
2 # onion
2 # carrots
4 cloves garlic
3 c rice
7 c water
6 # soup cubes
1 bunches kale (a bunch is about 4 cups)
2 # tomatoes
2 c peas

-Remove the tough stems of the kale, chop up the leaves, and set aside
-Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided skillet (or pot, if making a large batch), paella pan or wok over medium-high heat.
-Cut up onion and carrot, adding them.
-saute for 5 to 7 minutes, until the onions begin to soften and turn translucent.
-Chop the garlic in the meantime
-Add the garlic and saute for one minute.
-Add the rice and saute for one minute, until rice is coated with oil and the outside of the rice grains appear translucent.
-Chop the tomatoes
-Add the vegetable stock, kale, and tomatoes, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, until most of the liquid is absorbed.
-Stir in the peas, cover, and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes, until the rice is tender. Remove from the heat, and let stand for about 5 minutes.

Note: original recipe also had artichokes (1 can, though I doubled the recipe so it should be 2 cans).  I found fresh ones didn't work well (I didn't like them and probably didn't cut out the right parts of them), and a can of artichokes was hard to find.  I don't think I ever found the frozen ones.
Note: original recipe had 1 tsp of salt, but I found it too salty with the soup cubes as well.
note: original recipe had paprika
