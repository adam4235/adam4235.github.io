2 tbsp vegetable broth
1 tbsp lime juice
0.5 c breadcrumbs
0.5 c finely grated carrot
0.33 c corn kernels
1 tbsp red pepper flakes (this is actually too much, but it's what the recipe said - perhaps leave them out altogether)
1 tsp paprika

1 bit salt
1 bit pepper
2 tbsp vegetable oil

Sauce:
3 # tomatoes

-Pulse the beans for several seconds in a food processor or until coarsely chopped.
-Add remaining croquette ingredients except the oil and pulse for several seconds or until ingredients are just combined.
-Transfer the mixture to a bowl.  Use your hands to form 1/2-inch thick patties.  Place the patties on the prepared baking sheet.
-Drizzle the tops of the patties with oil.
-Bake the patties 15 min or until the tops begin to brown.  Use a spatula to flip the patties and bake an additional 15-20 min or until lightly browned.
