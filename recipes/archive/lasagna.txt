12 # lasagna noodles
1 # onions
1 cloves garlic
1 lb ground beef
700 ml pasta sauce
1 tsp parsley
1 tsp basil
1 tbsp sugar
500 g cottage cheese
1 # eggs
175 shredded_ml cheese - mozarella preferred

The first part consists of 4 steps, which can be done in any order:

1)Cook noodles.  Put 10 cups of water in a pot per 12 noodles, bring to a rapid boil.  Add the noodles.  Stir frequently until it starts boiling again.  Simmer for 12 min.  Drain.

2)Make sauce.  Chop onions and garlic.  Chop parsley if using fresh parsley. Cook ground beef in a frying pan.  Add onions and garlic and cook them too.  Add pasta sauce and parsley, stir them in, then once it starts boiling simmer 5 min. (Cover the frying pan with a lid to speed things up).

3)Make cheese mixture.  Combine cottage cheese and egg and stir together.

4)Grate cheese.

Preheat the oven to 350F.  I think the best layers are 3 noodles, then sauce, then 3 noodles, then cheese mixture, then 3 noodles, then sauce, then 3 noodles, then mozzarella cheese on the top.  Once it's in the dish, cover the dish with a cookie sheet or something and put it in the oven. Bake at 350F for 30-45 min.

Note: basil and sugar added to the recipe later
