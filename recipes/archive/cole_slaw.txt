0.25 # red cabbage
2 # carrots
3 spoonfuls veganaise
0.5 T vinegar (I used balsamic last time and it was good)
0.5 tsp maple syrup
0.125 tsp paprika
1 tsp mustard

-Get a huge bowl
-Chop the cabbage (ideally in a food processor or hand chopper, but not a blender), putting it in the bowl
-Grate the carrots, putting them in the bowl
-Mix everything in the bowl

Make sure you eat this within a few days.  I halved the recipe so it doesn't make as much.

Is the paprika necessary?  Next time try without it.
