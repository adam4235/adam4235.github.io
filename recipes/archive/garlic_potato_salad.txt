6 # potatoes
3 cloves garlic
2 stalks celery
0.25 c oil

-Scrub or peel potatoes, chop them up
-Boil potatoes for 5 min
-Chop celery and garlic
-Mix everything except potatoes in a large bowl
-Mix in potatoes
-Chill for 3 hours before eating (I only chilled for 1 hour)

Note: original recipe had 3 green onions instead of 2 stalks of celery.
Note: original recipe had 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, but it still tasted good without it.
Note: olive oil seems to make it much better than canola oil.
Original recipe had:
1 tsp rosemary
0.25 tsp salt
0.25 tsp black pepper
