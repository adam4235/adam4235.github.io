yield (meals * people): 3

0.5 c cous-cous
1 bit curry powder
1 bit butter
1 c water

Put the cous-cous and water on a stove element at maximum in a pot.
When the water boils, turn it down to minimum and wait 5 min with the lid on. DON'T STIR IT!  (That wrecks it).
There shouldn't be any water left to drain - if there is, keep boiling.
Add the curry powder and butter.
