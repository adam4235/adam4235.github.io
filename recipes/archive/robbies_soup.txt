2 stalks celery

1 tbsp savory
2 tsp thyme
0.5 tsp black pepper

-simmer 20 min
-Add lentils/barley/rice/potatoes if desired. (Try adding barley next time.)
-Add spices
-Boil, simmer 15-20 min

Note: original recipe involved 2 parts, with veggie scraps being fried and strained into the soup.  It was too complicated and wasteful though, so I modified it.
Note: I tried without the spices and there was a slightly better taste with spices, but it wasn't that significant.  Thyme might have made an especially low difference.
