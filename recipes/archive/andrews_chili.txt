Andrew's chili:

This recipe has been cut in 4

2 medium sized ripe tomatoes
1 medium sized cans of kidney beans
0.5 bulbs of garlic
1 pounds of ground beef
2 yellow onions
1/8 cup of sugar
1/8 cup of chili powder
1/16-1/8 cup of sunflower or canola oil
1 tsp of pepper
1 tbsp of salt

Dice tomatoes and place in 10L pot. Turn on to medium-high heat. Add beans, and bring to light boil. Add sugar, chili powder and salt. Stir, and reduce heat just enough to keep it boiling. Continue stirring periodically. Butter or canola oil should be added as well to add consistency. Cook mixture for at least 1 hour, and up to 3 hours depending on the desired softness of the beans. Mixture will darken with time.

Chop garlic, onions, and add to a large (12") frying pan, with the beef, pepper and some oil (preferably sunflower.) Cook on high. If pan becomes dry before onions and beef are browned add water. Turn frequently. (If you're stainless steel or cast iron pan it is critical that you keep the mixture wet as oil will not prevent sticking on high heat.)

Add beef/onion/garlic mixture to pot, and cook until desired thickness.

Makes 8-9 litres. (A lot)
