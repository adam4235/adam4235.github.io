-Fry the ground beef (doing the other steps in the meantime)
-Chop up the carrots
-Add frozen tortellini and carrots, bring to a boil, and simmer for 10 min.
-Add meat and salsa, bring to a boil, and simmer for 15 min.

Note: the purpose of the flour is to make the stew thicker. It wasn't in the original recipe but I think it improves it.
