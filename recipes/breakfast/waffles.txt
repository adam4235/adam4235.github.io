vegetable:9
meat:9

2 # eggs
2 c buttermilk
1 tsp baking soda
2 c flour (whole wheat, all purpose)
0.5 tsp salt
7 T oil (ex. Canola oil) (<0.5 c)
1.5 T sugar

Beat all ingredients together.  Put in waffle iron a bit at a time.  
The waffle iron must be preheated until the light goes off (with the 
waffle iron closed), then put some stuff in it, then the light should 
go back on after a bit when it's closed.  When the light goes back off, 
they're done.  Don't touch the waffle iron interior with metal to get 
them out!
