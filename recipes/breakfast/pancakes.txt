pancakes
vegetable:9
meat:9
servings (meals * people): 4

1 c wheat germ
0.875 c white flour
1 tbs baking powder
2 tsp sugar
0.5 tsp salt
0.33 tsp cinnamon
1.5 c milk
2 # eggs
0.25 c vegetable oil

-Beat together all ingredients except vegetable oil in a bowl with a whisk.
-Next time, try mixing in the vegetable oil too, and using the cast aluminum frying pan.  The oil is too hard to get even.
-Heat up a thin layer of vegetable oil in the frying pan, on medium heat.
-Bake them in the frying pan, for about 2 minutes on one side and 1.5 minutes on the other (3 and 2 turned out to burn them).

Note: can substitute Bisquick for the wheat germ, white flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, but it's not as good.
