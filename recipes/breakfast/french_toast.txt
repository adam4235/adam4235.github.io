2 # pieces of bread
1 # eggs
1.5 T milk
1 bit butter or margerine

Crack the egg and put it and the milk in a bowl.  Beat them with an egg beater
or fork until the mixture is
the same throughout, and for a little while longer.  Put the butter in a frying
pan and turn the heat up (on our stove to about 6 or 7).  Float a piece of bread
in the liquid, then flip it over with a fork and float the other side.  Put it
in the frying pan.  Repeat for each piece of bread.  When the bottom gets brown,
flip it over like a pancake and brown the other side.
