3 c flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 bunch sesame seeds (optional)
1 tbsp sprouting seeds
1/2 c oil
1.5 c water

Start making sprouts (see http://adam4235.github.io/recipes/snacks/sprouts.txt).  But instead of letting them become sprouts, wait until the baby plant just barely starts to break out of its seed (about a day or 2).
Mix everything including barely-sprouted-seeds in a bowl or directly in the frying pan
Fry for 15 min on each side (or less - I often only need 11 min on one side and 3 min on the other), optionally in oil (but not needed for non-stick pan)

Original recipe had a lot more baking powder (2 tbsp), but I found it tasted better with less.
