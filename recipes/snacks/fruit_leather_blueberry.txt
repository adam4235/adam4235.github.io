Same as Apple Cinnamon fruit leather, except don't use cinnamon, and replace some apple sauce that goes in the blender with blueberries instead.  (All the kinds of fruit leather require half apple sauce and half something else).  A ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 for applesauce:other fruit (raspberry, strawberry, or blueberry).
