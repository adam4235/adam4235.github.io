3 c flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 bunch sesame seeds (optional)
1/2 c oil
1.5 c water

Mix everything in a bowl or directly in the frying pan
Flour a surface and knead 10 times (optional)
Fry for 15 min on each side, optionally in oil

Original recipe had a lot more baking powder (2 tbsp), but I found it tasted better with less.
