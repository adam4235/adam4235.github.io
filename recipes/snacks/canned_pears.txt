1 ton pears
4 c sugar (could you use maple syrup or honey instead?) OR
1 bit nothing
1/2 tsp salt

-It's better to have a special canner (huge pot with a metal rack), because the jars have to go in the pot without touching the edges of the pot.  (It might be possible to use a large pot with a metal rack instead.)  Oma's recipe says there should be 4"-5" of water from the bottom of the pear jars.
-First make the syrup by using a ratio of 2:1 water to sugar (or maybe 3:1 is better) in a big pot.  Start that boiling.  To make 8 big jars you need about 8 c of water in the syrup.  But last time I tried making some without any sugar at all, just using water instead - do they taste good and last?
-Get the canner or huge pot out, and start the water in it boiling.  The water needs to cover the pears, so it's best to also have extra water boiling towards the to add to the big pot in case it wasn't filled full enough.
-You can peel pears and slice them into quarters.  But I didn't peel them, because I wasn't sure of the purpose of that.  Put them in water with 1/2 tsp salt (or better, lemon juice) while you're waiting to put them in jars for canning.  This prevents them from going brown while they're waiting (although it's not a big deal if they do, it's just for appearance).
-When the syrup is boiling, you can fill jars with pears and pour syrup over them.  You should try to get as many pears into a jar as possible, to prevent there being too much syrup in a jar.  Before adding the syrup, drain the jar of any water from your hands.  The syrup should cover the pears.  Screw the tops on, making sure they're centered and fairly tight (not as tight as you can get them).
-Boil in the canner for about 25 minutes, turning the heat to medium.  Don't have it boil too hard or the juice will boil out of the pears.
