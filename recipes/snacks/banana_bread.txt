This recipe is from Sandy's mom Lil.  It's the same as the one I found on the internet, but it has more sugar and less flour.


    * 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
    * 1 teaspoon baking soda
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 1/2 cup butter (1 vegan margerine container of butter is about 2 cups)
    * 1 cup brown sugar (the recipe said "sugar", but the one on the internet said "brown sugar")
    * 2 eggs, beaten, or 2 tbsp flax seed and 6 tbsp water
    * 2 mashed overripe bananas

DIRECTIONS

   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
   2. Mix everything together.
   3. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 65 minutes, until a fork inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
