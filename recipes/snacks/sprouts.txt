1. Put 1-2 tbsp of sprout seeds in a jar with a mesh lid, and fill the jar 1/2 full with water.
2. Let it sit for 6-8 hours
3. Drain through the mesh lid, without removing it
3. Rinse twice, each time filling the jar full with water, swirling, and then draining through the lid
4. Drain until all the water is out - leaving at 45 degree angle is ideal, but didn't seem necessary for alfalfa sprouts
5. Lay down so they are evenly spaced.  For mung beans, leave them in a dark place, such as a cupboard.  For other kinds, leave them in a lit location but usually not direct sunlight.  For alfalfa sprouts, you might be able to leave them in the sun at the end to make them turn green, which might be better for you, but don't leave them in the sun the whole time if they're in a jar.
6. Rinse, swirl and drain twice a day or more
