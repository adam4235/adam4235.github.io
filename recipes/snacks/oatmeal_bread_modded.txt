1.5 c rolled oats
0.75 c whole wheat flour
0.25 c crushed flax seeds
1 bit gluten
0.75 c honey
1.5 T salt
3 T vegetable oil
1.2 tbsp yeast
0.5 tbsp sugar
3 c whole wheat flour
4 c white flour

-Start about 4 c of water boiling
-Combine everything up to and including vegetable oil in a LARGE bowl
-Pour 3 c boiling water over the ingredients in the bowl
-Start yeast foaming by putting yeast and sugar in a bowl, then pouring lukewarm water over them.  The water should feel like nothing when you flick it against your wrist (that means it's at body temperature)
-After the water in the large bowl has cooled to lukewarm (about 10 min) and the yeast is foaming, add the flour and yeast to the large bowl.  First add a bit of flour, then the yeast, then the rest of the flour (might prevent the yeast from dying due to heat and salt).
-Knead for 10 min, adding more flour as you go.
-Grease 3 baking dishes.
-Split into 3 loaves and put in the baking dishes.  Cover and let rise until over the top.
-Bake at 350F for 35-40 min.
