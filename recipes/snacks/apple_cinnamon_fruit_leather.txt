1 bunch apples
1 bit cinammon
1 bunch honey

-First make applesauce: Cut up the apples into small pieces, then boil them on the lowest heat with a bit of water in the bottom in a huge pot.
-Get the dehydrator ready.
-Put half a blenderful of applesauce in the blender
-Add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a spoonful of honey.
-Blend on medium for about 15 seconds
-Align the teflon paper on a sheet
-Pour onto the sheet with the blade at the halfway point
-Smooth out with the blade
-Put in the dehydrator
-Repeat for each sheet
-Dehydrate at the temperature it says, for about 8-12 hours.  (Mom sets it to Medium, which is lower than the machine says, and leaves them in longer.)  When they're done you'll be able to slowly peel them off the teflon without anything sticky being left.
