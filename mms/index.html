    <h1>Texting pictures to me</h1>
    <p>I can't receive pictures or other files via text; I can only receive simple texts.  I made this page because people often try to text pictures to me.  This is what I see when someone tries to text me a picture or other file:</p>
    <img src="example.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Picture as text">
    <p>The reason for this is my cell phone plan doesn't have data, and texting pictures or files are a special type of message called MMS which requires the person receiving the picture/file to use data.  I don't know why I can't receive these messages over wifi, but I can't; I think it's a limitation of my cell phone provider.</p>
    <p>Three other ways you could send me pictures instead are <a href="../email.html">Email</a>, <a href="https://www.messenger.com">Messenger</a>, or <a href="https://app.element.io/">Element (matrix)</a>.  Of these, email seems like the simplest and best to me.</p>
