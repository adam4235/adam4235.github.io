<h1>The Meaning of the Version Numbers of my Software:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>If the version number is at least 1.0, it means the program has all the features it was originally intended to have, and is as properly coded as I know how to make it.  Less than that (e.g. 0.5) means it is incomplete but still useful enough to distribute.</li>
	<li>A -beta on the end (e.g. 1.2-beta) means I don't know of any bugs in the program, but I am not convinced it is bug-free.  (Note that many programmers use a regular version number even if there are known bugs or if they believe their program has bugs; I don't.)  I don't release alpha versions; only beta versions.</li>
	<li>A -bug on the end means at least one bug has been discovered in that package.  A package gets marked -bug once a bug has been discovered.  I normally list the known bugs nearby.  Note that, for example, this means 1.0.2-bug is the <i>exact same</i> package as 1.0.2 - the -bug was only added after the bug was discovered.</li>
	<li>In version numbers of the form a.b.c, the a is increased whenever the program has undergone a major change, such that there is an incompatibility between the current version and earlier versions.  For example, 2.0 may have a different file format than 1.0, so that a file created with version 2.0 could not be used with version 1.0.</li>
	<li>The b in a.b.c is increased whenever one or more new (backwards compatible) features are added to the program.</li>
	<li>The c in a.b.c is increased whenever a bug is fixed.  For the newest stable stream, I generally only make available the most recent of all versions which only differ in c.  For example, if the most recent stable version is 2.1.5, and 1.0.2 exists, I make 1.0.2 available for download but not 1.0.1 or 1.0.</li>
</ul>
