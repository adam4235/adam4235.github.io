<p>To use meals on Windows, create an environment variable called RECIPE_CONFIG and set it to wherever you want your configuration file (described in the documentation) to be located. An environment variable is a value stored by the computer that users can change
to configure the behavior of programs. The values they store are usually names
of files or directories that programs use. </p>

<p>To test that you've set up the environment variable and the configuration file correctly, run this DOS command:</p>

<pre>
dir %RECIPE_CONFIG%
</pre>

<p>It should list the file.</p>
