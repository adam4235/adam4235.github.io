	<h1>Environmental Tips</h1> 
	<ul>
        <li>I've also added a bunch more money saving strategies <a href="ere_strategies.txt">here</a>.</li>
		<li>Declutter things you don't need.  If you sell something to someone who can use it, that's one less person buying a newly produced version of it, and therefore a bit less pollution.</li>
		<li>Buy stuff on sale (or used, if applicable).  Stuff often goes on sale when it would otherwise be wasted, and when the seller isn't making money (or as much money) from it.</li>
		<li>Grow your own food, where feasible.  The transportation and production of food causes a lot of pollution and harm.</li>
		<li>Preserve fruits and vegetables by making things like canned fruit or tomato sauce, if you can get a lot of it cheaply at once (e.g. at harvest time, especially if you grow it yourself).</li>
		<li>You really don't need a car.  You just think you do.  Do the financial cost-benefit analysis and you'll see that they aren't worth it.</li>
		<li>Wash your clothes in cold water.  Heating the water accounts for most of the energy of washing clothes in warm or hot water.  This may require the use of a liquid detergent instead of a powdered detergent, since the powdered ones may not dissolve as well in water.  Theoretically, you can make your own liquid laundry detergent, but the recipe I tried didn't work very well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Washing your hands with hot water doesn't kill germs - although water that's hot enough would kill germs, it would have to be hot enough to burn you before that would happen.  So you might as well wash with just cold water and soap (since hot water costs money and energy)
        </li>
        <li>
            Liquid soap is much more expensive than bars of soap per use, and more harmful to the environment due to the plastic bottle.  You can also get a shampoo bar instead of shampoo, but some make your hair greasy.
        </li>
        <li>It's important to avoid products that are tested on animals, but beware when looking for cruelty-free toothpaste, because it often doesn't contain fluoride, and fluoride is important.  I got cavities after using such non-fluorinated toothpaste for a few years, and my dentist said it's because I need toothpaste with fluoride.  Two companies selling toothpaste with fluoride that aren't tested on animals are "Trader Joe's" and "Tom's of Maine" (I found a fluoridated version in Fredericton at Sequoia.  You can also order them online).
        </li>
        <li>
            Solar panels do cause carbon emmissions to produce, but that gets offset after about 2-3 years, and their lifetime is about 25-30 years (<a href="https://www.solar.com/learn/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-solar-panels/">Source</a>).
            <ul>
                <li>But another interesting thing from that article is that nuclear, hydro and wind have an even lower carbon footprint than solar.  So solar panels on your house is a good environmental choice if it's replacing coal or oil, but not if your power company is already getting all its energy from those other sources.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For solar panels in NB (Canada), a grid-tied system with <a href="https://www.nbpower.com/en/products-services/net-metering/">Net Metering</a> is the most environmentally-friendly choice, because it doesn't require batteries and batteries have an environmental impact.</li>
