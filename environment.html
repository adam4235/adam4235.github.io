	<h1>Environmental Tips</h1> 
    <p>If you follow the <a href="early_retirement_extreme.html">Early Retirement Extreme</a> philosophy then you'll already be taking a lot of environmental actions, but here are a few more tips:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>It's important to avoid products that are tested on animals, but beware when looking for cruelty-free toothpaste, because it often doesn't contain fluoride, and fluoride is important.  I got cavities after using such non-fluorinated toothpaste for a few years, and my dentist said it's because I need toothpaste with fluoride.  Two companies selling toothpaste with fluoride that aren't tested on animals are "Trader Joe's" and "Tom's of Maine" (I found a fluoridated version in Fredericton at Sequoia.  You can also order them online).
        </li>
        <li>
            Solar panels do cause carbon emmissions to produce, but that gets offset after about 2-3 years, and their lifetime is about 25-30 years (<a href="https://www.solar.com/learn/what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-solar-panels/">Source</a>).
            <ul>
                <li>But another interesting thing from that article is that nuclear, hydro and wind have an even lower carbon footprint than solar.  So solar panels on your house is a good environmental choice if it's replacing coal or oil, but not if your power company is already getting all its energy from those other sources.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For solar panels in NB (Canada), a grid-tied system with <a href="https://www.nbpower.com/en/products-services/net-metering/">Net Metering</a> is the most environmentally-friendly choice, because it doesn't require batteries and batteries have an environmental impact.</li>
	</ul>
